Patrick Scheibe,consistent fx color scheme for jabref,the pr aims to make the look and feel of jabref more consistent by providing a well-chosen set of base colors and deriving other colors from it at the moment i used a flat and bright scheme with the original jabref blue as the theme color![scrshot]( addition to the changes in the fx css files i provide an additional true type font for the application icons that are not available in the material design icon set it can be loaded and used in exactly the same way as the material design icons and only small changes to the code where necessary as soon as we agreed on using this i can make further adjustments and additions (currently wined is missing) to the icons so that they fit perfectly into our toolbar the one-colored icons should represent the original icon as much as possible and should be recognizable the will look like this![i1]( ![i2]( ![i3]( ![i4]( those who would like to help to work on this:our base style is `modenacss` and to make our restyling easy to use and to understand we should try to redefine the color variables of `modenacss` as much as possible instead of explicitly introducing and using our own variables this means dont use explicit color settings in the definition of styles for a control if it is a commonly used property eg the border color try to find and overwrite the appropriate modena-variable if you indeed need a specific color then re-use the ones defined at the top of `maincss`remember that this is unfinished at the moment and i have rather commented out lines than simply deleting it-----  change in changelogmd described-  -  manually tested changed features in running jabref-   ()-  (   ( [helpjabreforg](https://githubcom/jabref/helpjabreforg/issues)?),|| i played around with the ui a little and i like it i like the fact that the menu and tool bars are a little less color-intense than in the current maintable-betayou have my +1 for continuing with this line of work || i made further improvements to the custom icons and they look at least acceptable now if put on the toolbar:![toolbar]( more information on this view issue  i pulled the latest changes from maintable-beta im giving this free for review now note that there are still a lot of commented lines in the code to easily see what i have adjusted once we agree on something ill clean everything up || ive now merged this pr we can fine-tune the design later and ill provide a proposal for a dark theme in a new pr

Oliver Kopp," fix gui tests ""include """"append"""" functionality in the """"import entries dialog""""""", 5602 refs #2768wanted to know why our gui tests are broken the reason seems to be that we dont pass the preferences objects directly around but use `globalsprefs` at more places currently the issue is in `maintablejava`:```java        importhandler  new importhandler(                framegetdialogservice() database externalfiletypes                globalsprefsgetfilepreferences()                globalsprefsgetimportformatpreferences()                globalsprefsgetupdatefieldpreferences()                globalsgetfileupdatemonitor()                undomanager                globalsstatemanager)```i would propose to convert the constructor of `maintable` (and `basepanel`) to a builder pattern (because we have more than three arguments) and add passing of these preferencesalternatively we can mock `globalsprefsgetfilepreferences()` etc this is also ok for me as i accept global objects however we had a long discussion that we should get rid off `globals`is  the right issue where we discussed `globalsprefs`? i think the comment at  summarizes the discussion needs testing @stefan-kolb maybe? 😇 6049co-authored-by: christoph <siedlerkiller@gmailcom>co-authored-by: tobias diez <tobiasdiez@gmxde>co-authored-by: carl christian snethlage <50491877+calixtus@usersnoreplygithubcom>," "" || +1 for extracting `globalsprefs` and mocking the relevant data i dont think a builder pattern is necessary as the relevant classes are rarely initialized and all arguments need to be present anyway   || im not sure whether we should continue with it like that should we tryother solutions such as eclipse jubula - which are independent from theconcrete code i see that separate preferences for model and logic makessense for gui it is *much* effort is it really worth the effort? do weneed these kinds of tests? would it make more sense to do black box testing?maybe we should let this task (enable testing by testfx) be done bystudents in a training next year? seems to be much more work than expectedi wanted to come up with a quick solution to get it running to have ourtobias diez <notifications@githubcom> schrieb am do 26 dez 2019 09:45:> *@tobiasdiez* commented on this pull request> ------------------------------>> in src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/basepaneljava> < > @@ -1458 +1548 @@>      private optional<databasechangemonitor> changemonitor  optionalempty()>      private jabrefexecutorservice executorservice>> -    public basepanel(jabrefframe frame basepanelpreferences preferences bibdatabasecontext bibdatabasecontext externalfiletypes externalfiletypes) {> -        thispreferences  objectsrequirenonnull(preferences)> +    public basepanel(jabrefframe frame basepanelpreferences basepanelpreferences bibdatabasecontext bibdatabasecontext externalfiletypes externalfiletypes groupviewmode groupviewmode filepreferences filepreferences importformatpreferences importformatpreferences updatefieldpreferences updatefieldpreferences fileupdatemonitor fileupdatemonitor statemanager statemanager consumer<columnpreferences> updatecolumnpreferences supplier<timestamppreferences> timestamppreferencessupplier) {>> i think its better to pass a preferenceservice if you need to store> preference options (or get the current preferences at a later moment)>> —> you are receiving this because you authored the thread> reply to this email directly view it on github> < or unsubscribe> < > || i think gui tests would be nice to have its a good idea to let students extend the code coverage in a forthcoming project (similarly to what we did with the fetcher test suite) however we should provide a few basic tests that serve as an orientation with mvvm there shouldnt be any need for ui tests in the traditional sense (testfx or jubala or whatever) as one can simply write unit tests for the view model classes moreover the current gui tests dont add much value in my opinion for me it would be fine to remove all gui tests that we have currently || the whole """"mess"""" is only for the basepaneltest - to fix the other tests was easy i removed all the """"improvements"""" and made only cosmetic changes"" "

this way the code becomes more testable because the file dialog can be mocked away || @tobiasdiez  yes i already came up with a solution for this i will probably use some kind of factorpattern to create the dialogs that reduces the number of constructors/method overloads || ## [current coverage]( is **2754%**> merging 1336]( into [master]( will increase coverage by **+<01%**``` diff@@

unfortunately i have not that much time atm but i will try to see how far i get the next days mabye at the weekend i can get some time for it atm another project ist due on sunday) || got some time working on it || ready for review || i really like the new filedialog class and its fluent interface the code needs some cleanup in general (remove commented-out code and debug prints no abbreviations ) and then i think it is good to go || adressed comments @tobiasdiez  not sure if i understand you right on how i should handle the workingdir-prefs-stuffto me it does not make sense to pass the working dir to the constructor from an external call it would create unnecessary dependencies to the prefs  or what was your idea? || @oscargus  could you please have a look why the `cleanupcasesaddsbracketaroundaluminiumgalliumarsenid` test is failing?locally all is okay for me i have no idea what it could cause on travis  and i didnt touch any of the cleanup code in this pr  :confused:  "" || cool that you worked on this!as a suggestion i would not follow the original design very closely instead of having different lists for required and optional fields i would add one big list of all fields with a checkbox toggling between required/optional  || thanks for the idea that indeed sounds more practical maybe a radio button column  || question which just came to my mind: do we allow changing the default entry types and their fields? eg removing a field from an entry type like article?@koppor  || yes it was possible to add/remove fields from the built-in entry types || @tobiasdiez  what is the preferred way to add new fields to a an existing entry type?i saw the entrytypesmanager with  the `addcustomormodifiedtype`  but i am not sure if this is the right approach    || yes that methods sounds right i vaguely remember that the complete entry type had to be """"replaced"""" instead of only specifying the added/removed fields easiest way is probably to look at the original code || this looks really nice and is leagues above the original dialog in terms of user friendliness good job! || still a few things to do especially saving and removing all the fields back to the db and the prefs but at least adding to the gui already works (without any further effects) || @tobiasdiez  do you have an idea why the tableview content has these """"empty"""" fields when i change between a list with more and fewer fields? tableview is bound bidirecitonal to the fieldsfortypeproperty         thisfieldsfortypeproperty  new simplelistproperty<>(existingfieldsfortype)```        easybindsubscribe(selectedentrytypesproperty type -> {            if (type ! null) {                list<fieldviewmodel> typesforfield  typeswithfieldget(type)                existingfieldsfortypesetall(typesforfield)            }        })```( || the table view is programmed in such a way that always the complete visible table is filled with rows thus even if there is no data the toggle buttons moreover rows are reused (ie not re-created)i think it should suffice to add the check `item ! null` to  and perhaps add an else statement with `setgraphic(null)` || thanks! that worked! || `selected field null` in stdout when i open the dialog || @burrbull  thanks for your interest however this is still work in progress and not yet ready  especially saving is not yet implemented  || in `biblatex` mode there should be 3 position: `required` `optional` `optional2` || @burrbull  we want to drop the difference between optional and optional 2 field sin the long run we had already discussion about this in the past #2790 || hi a very useful functionality in 431 was the manual sorting (not only in alphabetical order) of the fields in the edit entry panel are you planning to implement this in this version? thanks for this nice work || general functionality is now ready loading saving and removing of types is possiblealso removing and adding fields to standard types is workingremoving standard entry types like article has no effect || can someone update builds? || @burrbull  we have currently some problems with our buildserver at buildsjabreforg however you can download it from here:  the top right corner click on artifacts:![grafik]( || bugwhen i try to move `optional` field to `required` whole `required` list emptiedi use biblatex || @burrbull  thanks for testing could you please add some more details on how to reproduce this`?what steps did you do where? || i think i found the problem working on it changes are not properly propagated || somehow the celledit event is not propagated to the listener here although the radiobuttoncell fires an event any idea where the problem could be @tobiasdiez ?code is adapted from here

tgettableview()getitems()get(tgettableposition()getrow())setfieldtype(tgetnewvalue())        })``` || @burrbull  i fixed the issue with the switch between required and optional aso the modified types are correctly loaded again from the preferences when opening the dialog || regarding the gui i jave just one more question: by default the required and optional are not shown complete i already tried to reduce the size of the left column but that didnt really work (i hate those column resizing shit in javafx)![grafik]( || you can try to set a preferred width in  you increase the scene width || now
