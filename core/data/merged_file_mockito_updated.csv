In this way  any comparison failures (such as the built-in argument comparison when running under JUnit) will also be collected rather than propagating through to the test framework.  There are also two commits which are more cosmetic improvements to  VerificationCollectorImplTest :  * Rename  assertAtLeastOneFailure()  to  assertExactlyOneFailure()  (more accurate description of what it does). * Change  Assert.fail()  to AssertJ s  assertBecauseExceptionWasNotThrown()  (produces better diagnostics in the case of a failure). When JUnit5+Mockito is used in modern IDE (IDEA  Eclipse) we now show  visual  comparison failure pop-up for certain Mockito exceptions (such as ArgumentsAreDifferent).  Fixes #1663. The original implementation of conditional OpenTest4J support (#1667) relied on some implicit behaviour of the Java classloader to generate and catch the exception at the right time. It seems that this behaviour is not always exactly replicated in all environments - for example  in #1716  where Mockito was being used in an instrumentation test that was being run on an Android emulator.  The new implementation is a bit more direct in how it tests for the dependent classes. The existing test cases still pass  and @matejdro confirmed that this fixed his problem.  Fixes #1716.,

Moreover  quite some licenses were reported missing  so I ran  ./gradlew licenseFormatMain licenseFormatTest  to add them. Introduce a new annotation  @CheckReturnValue  and add this to methods like  when  and  verify  such that static analysis can verify the value is actually used (http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/CheckReturnValue). This makes sure developers can get warnings on build-time instead of run-time (with our internal  validateState )  Fixes #1130 - Update licenses - Remove unused  buildSrc  - Remove old gradle files - Add some more tests - Fix coverage Remove several classes that were containers for code that is easier to be inlined. They were only referenced once  or never at all. This makes it easier to reason about the code  while also maintaining less code and classes.  Closes #904 Note that this implementation differs from the prototype implementation of the JUnitTeam (https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples/blob/7bf40178345d5ca837579c8ddb8c025401a98788/junit5-mockito-extension/src/main/java/com/example/mockito/MockitoExtension.java#L41-L73). Instead  it will do not do any parameter resolution between test methods.  Fixes #1348 When processing the reverse method  the type parameters are actually reversed compared to the type parameters in the class. This subsequently confuses GenericMetadataSupport  as it creates a cycle in  contextualActualTypeParameters . In that case A resolves to B  while B resolves to A.  The root cause is that we are processing type parameters of methods  while we already processed them in the class declaration. Therefore  ignore any type parameters if we already derived the appropriate contextual type parameter. ErrorProne caught this. We correctly had them on most of the deprecated methods  but not on all of them. This solves a large number of edge-cases where  null  will actually remove the runtime ClassCastException. This essentially negates the whole MockitoCast ErrorProne check. We can still not support every use case  but causing a NPE instead of a CCE does not seem to make this worse.  I am still running internal tests within Google to see if there are any regressions  but I already saw that some of the test failures we had with ByteBuddy were resolved with this particular patch.  Note that this now fully closes #357. A previous PR resolved the same issue with ReturnsSmartNulls: #1576.  Fixes #357 Fixes #1615  I hope the test is correct. At least it failed before and succeeds now... ReturnsMocks was exhibiting the same problems as we previously had with ReturnsSmartNulls. Extract that common behavior into a separate class and thus fix the issues with ReturnsMocks. The guard for final mocking was incorrect. It should have passed it on to MockitoCore. Since we have the InlineMockMaker  we can actually mock  so this check was incorrect. Also add  @NotExtensible  to several of our interfaces to document they are not intended to be subclassed.  Fixes #1609 There was only a single test failing on this. I think the issue was RETURNS_SMART_NULLS in combination with an ArgumentCaptor  but couldn t figure that part out. At least this fixes prevented the NPE. When the return type bound to a generic type resolved to Void   doNothing()  would still throw an exception. Update the  isVoid  implementation to also handle generic return types. This checker will warn on any usage of a Mockito internal symbol. Since we do not guarantee API stability on symbols in our internal packages  users should not rely on them. This checker can be used to enforce that they are unused. This is the reconciliation of #1556 with the tests fixed and implementation rebased on  release/2.x .  Fixes #1542 Spotless [1] has been used by various popular open source projects  including JUnit [2]. While working on Mockito inside of Google  I discovered that our formatting is inconsistent. We can use Spotless to automatically take care of that.  To be able to format the source code  run  ./gradlew spotlessApply  This check runs on Travis to make sure code remains formatted. This should also reduce the amount of trouble with the CheckStyle linter  as Spotless will automatically resolve these issues.  On purpose  the spotless configuration is quite minimal. The current configuration is mostly a reflection on the current state of affairs. We can later discuss different configuration options and how we can integrate them.  [1]: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/master/plugin-gradle [2]: https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/3f491f3148d2c745808fc75b0a802b60243e104e/build.gradle.kts#L124-L144 This method was added in Mockito 2 ([1]) and was implemented in all relevant subclasses. However  most subclasses do not implement a custom description.  Since we are now building on Java 8  we can ship this as a default method and remove all duplicate subclass implementations. As a side-effect  it allows users of Mockito 1 to migrate to Mockito 3 without additional breakages. (They could implement it  but VerificationModeFactory is internal and would require additional boilerplate)  [1]: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/68 Spotless allows us to enforce a consistent import order. Configure it such that static imports are first and non-static imports afterwards. Within imports  java imports first  then javax  then all others.  This is consistent with the existing CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines  apart from the fact that static imports are first. (File has been updated). I would propose that makes more sense  but happy to discuss.  In any case  spotless already found inconsistent ordering within imports themselves  so that is already providing value for consistency.  I have also updated the CONTRIBUTING guidelines to explain how  ./gradlew spotlessApply  will fix a lot of issues without the developer having to worry about it. That should hopefully help newcomers make changes more confidently.  (The only 2 files that are interesting to you are the  build.gradle  and  .github/CONTRIBUTING.md . All other file changes were automatically performed after running  ./gradlew spotlessApply  locally.) This class was used during the migration period from Mockito 1 and Mockito 2  but is no longer necessary. To be able to remove our dependency on Hamcrest  we should remove MockitoHamcrest.  In response to #1817 Discovered in #1818 that (if new contributors are unaware of our indentation with 4 spaces)  spotless did not fix the formatting.  indentWithSpaces(4)  does just that and it actually found other formatting issues. We discovered that users run into issues with using the wrong Mockito matcher for arguments. Examples include  any(Integer.class)  instead of  anyInt()  and  anyInt()  instead of  anyFloat() . Users then run into cryptic run-time errors that are difficult to understand.  These ErrorProne checkers make these a compile warning  to warn the user before hand. They also provide the appropriate fixes that can be directly applied. Reverts mockito/mockito#1818  Fixes #1843 JUnit has two types of test rules: MethodRule and TestRule. The existing MockitoJUnit rule returns a MockitoRule which extends MethodRule. However  since this is not a TestRule  some features of JUnit do not nicely integrate with Mockito. For example  the RuleChain feature of JUnit only works on TestRules.  Therefore  add a separate entrypoint to MockitoJUnit which returns a TestRule that can be integrated with RuleChain. It introduces a separate interface to make this distinction clear. If we would change the existing MockitoRule to also extend TestRule  the JUnit logic would no longer run the MethodRule [1] and would thus break existing users.

This makes sure that whenever there are multiple type candidates  it will hold off injecting if it finds a different field which has the correct matching name. Add new API method to reset invocations of a mock  while maintaining all existing stubbing.  ---  **EDIT by mockito team** : Fixes #183 It will report in the end the result of multiple statements. Fixes #124 When googling the mocking of builders  a lot of people said it was not possible with Mockito to support them in a clean way.  RETURNS_DEEPS_STUBS  does allow cascading  but can become quite fast very cumbersome. The added  RETURNS_SELF  will try to return itself by looking at the method  returnType  and compare this with the class of the mock. Google-java-format is an open source formatter [1]. It automatically formats source code based on the Google Java Style.  The Mockito source code to a very large extent already adheres to this style guide. While this PR in itself is large  many of the changes are related to string formatting and nested method calls. Most notably  google-java-format is an improvement over the current formatting strategy in that:  1. It handles comment formatting (e.g. spacing between comments) 2. It handles nested method calls. You can see the difference in our usage of the ByteBuddy API  which is now more consistent 3. It enforces the max-line length.  It essentially automates all of the styling rules we list in https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/release/3.x/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#alignment As such  for new contributors it should be a lot easier (and less scary) to contribute to Mockito  as they no longer have to be concerned about formatting. Hopefully  this once again lowers the bar for external contributors who want to help the project  but would otherwise feel overwhelmed by the rules we have to adhere to. (If we wouldn t have these rules  it would be a lot harder for us to maintain a consistent and maintainable codebase).  The only interesting changes in this PR are those in  build.gradle . All other changes were auto-generated by running  ./gradlew spotlessApply .  Note that I disabled the formatting of Javadoc  as I think we should keep formatting that ourselves. We normally put a lot of time and effort in our Javadoc and changing that all at once seems like the wrong decision at this point in time.  [1]: https://github.com/google/google-java-format 9/10 are EOL since September 2018. 14 is the currently supported Java version. As originally requested in #287: lazily verify all  Mockito.verify(...)  calls inside JUnit test cases. Some general issues reported by IntelliJ. Mostly concerning modifiers and unused imports. TODO: Add a regression test to also show how this functionality can be used. CC @smoyer64  Fixes #438 A quick google showed that there are almost zero usages of this runner. Moreover it was relying on a very hackish implementation. I think we can do a better job by creating a new runner with JUnit 5 as part of #390. Therefore the intent is to deprecate these classes and remove them in Mockito 3.0.  Fixes #489 Simple git revert for an accidental removal of a deprecated api since 2.0 instead of 1.X.  Fixes #482. Discovered while trying to sync Mockito internally at Google. Discovered internally at Google. The culprit was a thread race condition around the usage of usedAt  which could race between setting the field and retrieving it. Supersedes and closes #2188 This is the result of running ErrorProne on the codebase. Most notably  it adds missing override annotations  adds private constructors for classes that should not be subclassed  removes redundant generic type specified and fixes handling of casts/instance checks. Fixes #551 Most links are replaced by their GitHub equivalent. Some links were pointing to issues on code.google.com  but given the large amount of documentation on these methods I decided to remove them.  Fixes #533 Let s see if this actually works. Testing for #520 When using Mockito without opentest4j  reporting an ArgumentsAreDifferent exception would throw a StackOverflowError when attempting to obtain the message from the exception.  The root problem was that super.toString() would call its own getMessage(). Instead  we should obtain the message from the super  to avoid the circular call. References first step of #848 Colleague students ran SonarQube on Mockito. These were some easy fixes I was able to do  no extreme value. I will open an issue regarding a different and potentially more serious issue. Yeah  we did this quite some time ago and this merge was hell. I hope I did not screw anything up. There are still 7 test failures  but I have to get dinner now. Please review this PR very carefully  to make sure I did not introduce regressions into master :sob: Regression that shows the issue of #1174. I am unable to reproduce this locally. Let s see what Travis says.  Closes #1174 Because we should do this more frequent :joy:,

Thus  add them.  The other part is functions  returning inline classes. There can be several kinds of inline classes - with primitive underlying type (nullable or not-null) and reference types (nullable or not-null). Also  a function can return either nullable of not-null inline class. If a function returns nullable inline class  we do not do anything special - the function s signature contains inline class. However  if the function returns not-null inline class  its signature contains underlying type  thus  we need to unbox the inline class (i.e. get underlying type s value) to mock the return value.  For example  if we have the following inline class    inline class IC(val i: Int)  and we want to mock return value of a function  returning the inline class    fun returnsIC(): IC  like     when (mock.returnsIC()).thenReturn(IC(1))  then if we do not unbox the argument of  thenReturn  function  we get error about incompatible types.  The only issue  however  is that we cannot check  whether the function indeed returns  IC   unless we use kotlin.reflect. So  the following code will work.    fun returnsInt(): Int     when (mock.returnsInt()).thenReturn(IC(1))  Fixes issue #1930  <!-- Hey   Thanks for the contribution  this is awesome.

In the additional commits  I ve taken the liberty to implement my proposals from https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/445#issuecomment-358407562:  - Add  MockitoSessionBuilder.name(String)  to pass a name from the testing framework to the  MockitoSession  - Add  MockitoSessionBuilder.logger(MockitoSessionLogger)  to customize the logger used for hints/warnings produced when finishing mocking (useful for testing and to connect reporting capabilities provided by testing frameworks such as JUnit Jupiter) - Add  MockitoSession.finishMocking(Throwable)  to avoid potentially confusing warnings for failing tests - Add  MockitoSession.setStrictness(Strictness)  to change the strictness of the current session (there were two test cases requiring that)  Each of these changes is in a separate commit. Thus  it should be relatively easy to take only those changes that you think good  or just the first one to fix #1232.  To showcase that this new API is sufficient to implement an extension of a testing framework  I ve changed the  JUnitRule  implementation to use it. Prior to this commit   DefaultInternalRunner  threw an exception when  MockitoAnnotations.initMocks()  failed from the overridden  withBefores  method. Instead  it now returns a  Statement  that is responsible for initializing. Potential exceptions are then handled by JUnit  regardless whether version 4.12 or 4.13-beta-2 is used. Instead of reporting a class-level error  JUnit will now report a failure for each test method in such test classes.

Before this commit the location on an unwanted interaction was not reported properly. Instead of      No interactions wanted here: -> at <package>.<TestClass>.<testMethod>(<TestClass.java>:<lineNumber>)      the assertion message said:      No interactions wanted here: -> at org.junit.runners.ParentRunner.runLeaf(ParentRunner.java:325)      The issue with the current behaviour in master is that all stacktrace elements above an element containing  org.mockito.  are removed. As  org.mockito.internal.junit.JUnitRule  fullfills this condition and comes below the  payload  (i.e. test code and code under test) stack elements the interesting part of the stack is filtered. In case the pull request #317 (which we only found after hacking on this) is merged this pull becomes obsolete except for the two tests that are added: - checking that the  payload  stack elements aren t removed from the stack and - a test for removal of the Byte Buddy stack elements.,

Fixes #1621 This pull request will enable mocks to be serialized in a certain way  that will allow them to be serialized and especially deserialized outside the classloader the mock was created.  At the moment it s enabled automatically when using  withSettings().serializable() .  It still require to have Mockito on the classpath of the JVM classloader where it is deserialized. nan See issue #99   What it does is propagating the serializing mode of the parent  upon each mock creation when deep stubbing.  Before each mock created where made serializable by default. Which is not an issue when the types have a default no arg constructor  but may become problematic when the type didn t have one  Mockito would report an error explaining that it couldn t mock this type. Fixes issue #187  The value returned by the default answer is now validated to make sure there won t be a  ClassCastException  if the default value is incompatible with return type.  Reporter now fetch in safer way the mock name  in case the default answer is incorrectly implemented. This avoid a  ClassCastException  when reporting a verification issue. This should fix #233  (Awaiting delivery of bytebuddy fix https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/commit/6f223d93ee57b199abf0e7abaf4837df6d041f41)  Thanks @raphw In some recent version of mockito  @Spy  annotation will use the constructor rather than objenesis  that mean that constructor carry actual work. But since the interceptor set after instantiation  this raised an NPE with ByteBuddy. It wasn t an issue with CGLIB but it probably didn t event intercept such calls (unconfirmed at this point).  This PR aims to fix that by calling real code  if interceptor is not set  which can only happen if  ConstructorInstanciator  is used  Thanks to @raphw for his tip on this regard as well : https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/issues/32#issuecomment-113269844 Mock makers may have different capabilities. Historically CGLIB and Mockito were deeply related  later Mockmaker was created to allow Android developers to use dexmaker to create mocks. But logic that decided if a type could be mocked still reside in the mockito base  while it should be the responsibility of the mockmaker.  Also for example one could create his own mockmaker that forbid to mock type if some annotation is present. The motivation behind this rework  is that developers using JDK7+ see compiler warnings on some varargs methods.  While these warning are false alarms  users may not feel the same way. These compiler warnings cannot be entirely avoided   annotations like  @SafeVarargs  don t work on interfaces  and  @SuppressWarning({ unchecked    varargs })  have a limited impact on user code.  **As these annotations have limited impact  and most people use a single argument anyway  I propose to to introduce API that takes a single argument. While an overload can takes more arguments**  If we don t do that i.e. if we keep the same API with compiler warnings it may encourages users to add  @SuppressWarning({ unchecked    varargs })  in their test code  thus potentially hiding bugs in their code base. Test coverage reports have been broken with gradle without satisfying explanation  for quite some time. This pull request hopes to fix things Will fix #243 - null check on MockUtil.isMock() was incorrectly removed after successive refactoring  this PR reintroduces null check The  Reporter  friendly exception factory class lies in  org.mockito.exceptions.Reporter   however it s API is subject to change without really impacting user experience.  Thus  I propose to move  org.mockito.exceptions.Reporter  to  org.mockito.internal.exceptions.Reporter .  I didn t provided a dummy class for two reasons : 1. I would like to schedule this for Mockito 2 a major version 2. This class shouldn t be used outside framework development Renames  Matchers  to  ArgumentMatchers  to avoid name clash with Hamcrest  org.hamcrest.Matchers  class.  This plagued usage of mockito and hamcrest together since the introduction of matchers. The work in Mockito 2 beta allowed to avoid relying on hamcrest internally and thus split the Hamcrest matcher factory  MockitoHamcrest . Yet this is not enough as using both mockito matchers and hamcrest matchers in the same class  made the developer life not comfortable when using both API.  This change helps in that regard  as it renames the import class. Not this change tweaks only the class hierarchy  so current code still compiles  thanks to the javac compiler that can lookup static method in parent classes. (That is why I didn t updated tests yest  they could be upgraded in a late PR  a good timing would probably be when  Matchers  is removed)   Matchers  class can be removed in the next version of mockito  likely 3.0. Details is #194   I took the opportunity to  - replace  TestBase.assertThat  by more powerful AssertJ equivalent. There s still some work to be done in this class. - add iterable matchers  Before merging - [x] I ponder to make  anyObject()  not to accept  null   currently  any()  is an alias of  anyObject()  => Keeping the  anyObjet  behaviour and deprecate the method - [x] I need to update  anyInt  family description. Follow up on #510 (issue #194) following this comment https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/510#issuecomment-236877717  Basically it tweaks the collection matchers with generic support. It should have bee in abf9851. Changes NPE to IAE  see #554 #589 aimed to fix the javadoc rendering  but the assumption was that the javadoc tool of the Sun JDK6 will render javadoc the same way as openjdk6.  Unfortunately this is not the same  the javadoc rendering of openjdk6 is a pre work that avoid the use of table elements  this making the stylesheet incompatible.  This PR aims to fix that and thus fix #552   Bonus I changed the  2.*  and  2.0  by  2.0.0  in the javadoc  this way we have aligned version numbers The Java 8 helper interfaces have been introduced in #338. However the public  AdditionalAnswers.answer  family leak the functional interfaces.  These _parameter arity_ interfaces can be public  hence they are moved next to  Answer  in the  org.mockito.stubbing  package.  I m however in favor of adding the  @Incubating  annotation on those APIs and related objects. Thoughts ?  Fixes #614 Fixes #640 Warns user to upgrade if Java 8 version is to low.  Also took the opportunity to log other platform details if mock class cannot be created. Currently the code can print some arguments without necessary casts  see https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/571#issuecomment-241357864.  Before the exception message contained :       iMethods.forByte(0x19)      Which is actually not valid java. So the exception message now prints       iMethods.forByte((byte) 0x19)      This PR intends to fix it  this especially affects short and byte values. All in the title. This should fix #707 After using mockito  I have found that the new behaviors of matcher are good and indeed show problems in the test code or in the production code. However I have found that I miss an easy way to express a matcher for  nullable  argument when the production code may produce either  null  or value types  typically  Stream.of(<mixed values>).map(o -> mapper.map(c))...   the current options are :  *  <T> T any()  is nice but don t check the type. * there s always  AdditionalMatchers.or()  but this feel more heavy to use.  I m proposing the introduction of the argument matcher  <T> nullable(Class<T>)  which is a combination of  isA  and  isNull . I m not adding  <T> T nullable()  because this would have the same meaning as  <T> T any() Currently  addListener  and  removeListener  returns  void  which makes it repetitive to add or remove these :     java Mockito.framework().addListener(...)  Mockito.framework().addListener(...)  Mockito.framework().addListener(...)       The main change of this PR is to return  MockitoFramework  instead  thus allowing to chain invocations :     java Mockito.framework().addListener(...)                    .addListener(...)                    .addListener(...)       This improvements is a breaking change  however the API is still **incubating** and should be expected to break  source wise there s no problem since nothing could be done before due to the  void  return. This PR proposes to regroup all JUnit related classes in corrct packages. There s two changes :  * public : Deprecates  org.mockito.runners.MockitoJUnitRunner  and moves logic over  org.mockito.junit.runners.MockitoJUnitRunner     Questions :      * Should the runner be moved in the subpackage  junit.runner  or regroup the runner along with the rule in the  junit  package? (JUnit 5 will have neither of those)     * Should I do the same for already deprecated runners (console spamming and verbose runner)  * private : Moves JUnitHackerTool to  org.mockito.internal.junit.util Previous attempts at fixing the time related tests failed. Indeed the previous attempts are not bullet proof when the CI can run schedule some threads slower than _expected_.  A proper harness should be implemented  but in the meantime  I implemented the retry rule as proposed in #731 to gain back stability on the build. Related to #801  this PR simply adds a warning for IBM J9 VMs if the mock maker fails. Currently  AnnotationEngine  can be overrriden with the _deprecated_  MockitoConfiguration   in order to be more consistent with the new way  I propose to get the  AnnotationEngine  from the  PluginRegistry .  Regarding backward compatible behavior  if the  MockitoConfiguration  class exists and can be seen then Mockito will select the engine of this configuration instead of the  Plugins  one. If  MockitoConfiguration  class don t exist then Mockito wil chose the  Plugins  one.  Bonus I extended the classloader util to support some tests. Since Mockito 2 / #380 captured arguments is not anymore done for already verified interactions.     java IMethods mock = mock(IMethods.class)  mock.oneArg( first )  ArgumentCaptor<String> argument = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(String.class)  verify(mock  times(1)).oneArg(argument.capture())  assertThat(argument.getAllValues()).isEqualTo(1)   // additional interactions mock.oneArg( second )  argument = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(String.class)  verify(mock  times(2)).oneArg(argument.capture())  assertThat(argument.getAllValues()).isEqualTo(2)  // fail with mockito 2      The current behavior (Mockito 2.1 - 2.3.3) of  NumberedInvocationChecker  clears already verified interactions  before verifying the remaining interactions so the new argument captor is not populated with previous values. Which is akward if the times value is different that the lit size. Attempt at fixing #820  Basically it makes the ReturnsArgumentAt answer a bit more smart about varargs. But I m not satisfied with the fix yet. ## Overview  Custom Answers are now more robust - users can add add validation logic to the Answer implementation. It can validate the return type early  during stubbing in test  rather than fail late  during execution of code under test. Mockito team uses this API behind the hood for all custom implementations of Answer interface. Now advanced users can leverage this new API  too!     java class MyCustomAnswer implements Answer  ValidableAnswer { // <-- note extra  ValidableAnswer  interface   public Object answer(InvocationOnMock invocation) {     // answer implementation   }    public void validateFor(InvocationOnMock invocation) {     // throw MockitoException if answer cannot be applied to given invocation   } }        ## Implementation  While trying to fix #820 / #821  I noticed that  AnswersValidator  knew too much about other answers. To fix the design issue I propose the following design :  * Introduce  ValidableAnswer  in public API which is a single method interface that doesn t extends  Answer . * Each answer that wants to be validated hence implement this interface  Benefit  reduced visibility of some methods in these answers. Each new answer that want to be validated can just by implementing the new contract.  Validating returned value of a mock s default answer had to be handled differently.

So on a next interaction with a mock  the listener was called  as such the last interaction is  void onVerification   so the answer could not be validated.  The case is easy to reproduce :     java interface Foo {     String nonVoid(String param)      void doSomething(String param)  } @Test public void should_not_call_listener_when_verify_was_called_incorrectly() {     //when     Foo foo = null      VerificationListener mockListener = mock(VerificationListener.class)      Mockito.framework().addListener(mockListener)      try {         verify(foo).nonVoid(  )          fail( Exception expected. )      } catch (NullInsteadOfMockException expected) {         //then         verify(mockListener  never()).onVerification(any(VerificationEvent.class))     }     // Mockito.framework().removeListener(mockListener)  // fix      // done in CleaningUpPotentialStubbingTest     try {         when(null).thenReturn( anything )  // throws instead CannotStubVoidMethodWithReturnValue         Assertions.fail( expected )      } catch (MissingMethodInvocationException e) {}  }      Given the conditions to reproduce the bug I d say we can keep the code that way. This should help for cases like #822   NPE can be raised by the JVM on the callsite of a matcher returning object like  any() . The thing is that the JVM does several thing like to allows a type to match a signature like  <T> T any()   type inference with Java 8  cast and unboxing. However  any()  can only return  null  so the JVM raises an NPE on the cast opcode. Of course the problem isn t new but more possible due to Java 8 flexibility. That s why Mockito had for a long time the primitive.  When mockito is used with the junit runner or the junit rule there s a  InvalidUseOfMatchersException  raised **after** the NPE with a message about misplaced matchers. This exception is raised because the matchers were not consumed by the mock since the NPE is raised first. So this exception is correct and can help the neophyte to discover the primitive variant like  anyInt() . Following discussion in #838 it is sensible to add a mockito matcher that can take a  Pattern  as an argument.  The usage is the same as  matches(String) .     java when(mock.oneArg(matches(Pattern.compile( [a-z]+\\d\\d )))).thenReturn(...)       Although it allows to build more complex regex  especially with regular expression flags. Fixes #860   This internal assumed JaCoCo fields will always be  static final   obviously not. JaCoCo 0.7.8 changed that. The simple fix was to make the source field _accessible_ instead of skipping this field.  Hence removing the test exclusion. This simple piece of code prevents the  SpyAnnotationEngine  to try create a spy instance for a some inner private class with different set of modifiers.  While preventing execution it reports slightly better error messages  before  some time the cause was  null  . This should fix #878 Fixes #876 and do a bit more cleanup  * Moves returning empty array from  ReturnsMoreEmtpyValues  to  ReturnsEmptyValues  * Cleans up javadoc * Removes reflection for Java8 types (implementation and tests)  Best to review commit by commit.

The implementation was straight forward and the docu is top notch. Not comparable to a JUnitRule or Runner implementation. One can feel the hard work.   ----  The here provided  MockitoExtension  allows to mock/spy/validate like the well known Mockito-JUnitRule/Runner. This is still  work in progress   feel free to comment.  Usage:     Java @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) class JUnit5Test {     @Mock   private Dependency mock      @Test   void checkMockCreation(){     when(mock.foo()).thenReturn( Hello JUnit5 )      mock.foo()      verify(mock).foo()    } } The enum type Answers implements now the Answer interface. This allows us to use the enum values in  Mockito.mock(Class Answer) . This is handy when you have to test legacy code with PowerMockito and want to use both  @Mock  and  Mockito.mock(..) .      java @Mock(answers=RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS)  ClassA a  ClassB b   public void setUp(){   b= mock(ClassB Mockito.RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS)   //<< static import is not possible here  but with this pull request we can use RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS we used in @Mock. } This pull request fixes #365 by introducing  T getArgument(int)  and deprecating  T getArgumentAt(int Class<T>)  in type  InvocationOnMock . This improves the readabilty of custom Answers.   This...  String text = invocation.getArgumentAt(1 String.class)   can be replaced by...   String text = invocation.getArgument(1) Fixes #374 removed deprecated classes and methods Fixes #426 for class Reporter   This PR changes the way errors are created and thrown. All methods of the Reporter are now static so they can be imported statically and return an exception instead of throwing it directly. This improves the readability and eliminates the use of hacks to satisfiy the compiler.  Here is a sample:      public List<T> getLastVarargs() {         if (arguments.isEmpty()) {             Reporter().noArgumentValueWasCaptured()              return null          } else {             return arguments.getLast()          } }      The above code snipped can be rewritten to this:      public List<T> getLastVarargs() {         if (arguments.isEmpty()) {             throw noArgumentValueWasCaptured()          }          return arguments.getLast()  } #426  While refactoring the class HandyReturnValues  towards a static utility class I notices that it is not required at all. Therefore I decided to remove the type  HandyReturnValues . #426  Refactored  InvocationMarker to a static utility class Refactored concurrent test in order to fix #433. The implementation now uses  an  Executor to perform async calls instead of extending  Thread  and doesn t extend TestBase anymore.   I also added a Stopwatch which can be used for further time dependent testing. In the future I want to use this class to write more tests for After/Timeout. The actual implementation of [ThreadSafeMockingProgress](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/master/src/main/java/org/mockito/internal/progress/ThreadSafeMockingProgress.java) disguise that it is effectively a singleton cause the ThreadLocal member is static. This makes it hard to see that different instances  share the same state.  This PR... - refactores  ThreadSafeMockingProgress to provider of MockingProgress instances - uses the standard way of instantiating the initial  ThreadLocal value this also avoids possible race conditions Removed dead/unnecessary classes: - VarargCapturingMatcher and Test - AnyVararg removed in Favor of Any  Any can now used as varargs matcher too       removed test [shouldNotAllowAnyObjectMatchEntireVararg()](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/master/src/test/java/org/mockito/internal/invocation/ArgumentsComparatorTest.java#L110) cause it was not clear why ANY should not be allowed as varargs matcher - Unified  AtLeastXNumberOfInvocationsChecker  and    AtLeastXNumberOfInvocationsInOrderChecker  into a static utility class - Unified  MissingInvocationChecker  and  MissingInvocationInOrderChecker  in   a static utility class refactored SuperTypesLastSorter to a static utility class  relates to #426 Inlined ArrayUtils.isEmpty() in ArgumentsProcessor and removed ArrayUtils cause it was only used in ArgumentProcessor.

This PR unifies the decision logic how matchers are applied to argument+varargs by introducing a  MatcherApplicationStrategy . This strategy can apply an action to an pair of ArgumentMatcher and Argument. One action is used to perform the ArgumentMatcher.matches(arg) call and an other is used to perfrom the capturing. - fixes #439 ArgumentCaptor and ArgumentMatcher s can now be mixed in varargs - fixes #583 No more NPE when null is passed to an varargs  - added 25 regression tests in VarargsTest (5 are ignored cause they belong to other issues and fail currently)  - reduced logic duplication New approach to fix flickering async tests.

I would like to unifiy  RemoveFirstLine    Decamelizer  and  StringJoiner  to a new type  StringUtil . They all manipulate strings and contain only a few methods that are not worth to live in a dedicated classes  any thoughts? fixes #927  This PR allows to use  doNothing(..)  for methods with return type  java.lang.Void  like void-methods.    To solve this  InvocationInfo.isVoid()  checks now the return type for the pseudo-type of the keyword  void  or  Void . Fixes #1071   The parameter type inference takes now the type of the actual instance into account to avoid type erasure issues in case the parameter is generic.  see also: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/1071#issuecomment-300091021 Fix for #1155  Mockito.thenThrow(Class) now fails when the given Throwable type is not declared on the stubbed method.,

Fixed grammar issue in  ArgumentMatchers :  > This implementation is due static type safety imposed by java compiler.  Should be:  > This implementation is due to static type safety imposed by java compiler.  This PR fixes issue #879. Cherry-pick PR #880 to the 2.x branch  This PR should fix issue #879 on this branch too. Calling  toStirng()  on a string just returns the same instance  making this call quite useless. This patch removes those calls in order to clean up the code a bit. Concatinating Strings creates a temporary StringBuilder  which is then converted to a String. Having such an argument inside a StringBuilder#append call thus pointless. Using a chained append call will have the exact same outcome  and would profit a slight [probably unnoticeable in this instance] performance benefit. This patch applies de-facto standards the codebsae currently has regarding whitespaces on all the java files in the project:  - Newlines were added at the end of files that didn t have them. - Whitespaces at the end of source lines were removed.  All these changes were done by running  sed  on the codebase. The exact details can be found in the individual commit messages. ## Motivation and design - see #685  To quote the requirement (see in-depth design in #685): > We already support spying on abstract classes by allowing parameterless constructor. However  there is no support for constructor parameters. This has been asked about long time ago. Mockito API is not robust enough if it supports mocking with constructor but not when one has any constructor parameters.  This patch enhances the  MockSettings#useConstrctor()  method (as suggested in the alternative API comment in the issue) and adds optional ellipsis arguments that are passed to the constructor.  The patch streamlines the creation of mocks via constructors to a single flow  where using a no-arg constructor or an enclosing class are just private cases of this flow  and don t require their own special treatment. Commit da4e42 introduced a static import from the non-existent  org.mockito.internal.util.StringJoiner  (it exists only in the master branch  not the release/2.x branch). This patch fixes the build by correcting the import to reference  org.mockito.internal.util.StringUtil . With the current code (introduced in Mockito 2.7.14 by commit 6a82c03)  calling  MockSettings.useConstructor  with an argument list that would be applicable to more than one constructor would fail with an  org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.InstantiationException .  This behavior  however  is suboptimal  as described in issue #976  as it makes  useConstructor  less robust than the Java compiler  which is able to resolve such ambiguities. With this patch  Mockito will attempt to match the constructor with the most specific parameter types. A constructor X is considered more specific than a constructor Y if:  1. They are both applicable to the given argument list 2. Constructor X has at least one parameter which is a further specialization of the corresponding parameter of constructor Y (i.e.  paramX.isAssignableFrom(paramY) ). 3. Constructor Y has no parameter which is a further specialization of the corresponding parameter of constructor X  as defined above.  E.g.  consider the following class:      public class SomeClass {         SomeClass(Object o) {}         SomeClass(String s) {}     }  Without this patch  calling      mock(SomeClass.class  withSettings().useConstructor( string! ))  would fail. With this patch  such a call would invoke the  SomeClass(String)  constructor.   As noted above  this PR fixes issue #976. During development work  orphaned  unused  imports sometime get left behind in the code. At best  these imports are just redundant. At worst  they introduce false dependencies in places there aren t supposed to be any dependencies.  This patch removes all those unused imports and adds a Checkstyle module to verify no such redundant imports will be introduced in the future. Use numeric literals  which are more elegant  instead of casting int literals to other primitive types. Commit  6a82c030756a30932406d6b807e7ca34f20631e3 (included in Mockito 2.7.14) changed  MockSetting#useConstructor  s signature to accept an  Object...  argument. While this change is backwards compatible (as calls can continue passing an empty argument list)  it broke the javadoc reference to  useConstructor()  in Mockito s javadoc. Calling  toString()  on a String object just returns the same object  making such calls useless in most cases.  This patch removes such calls from  SmartPrinterTest   making the code a cleaner and easier to read. This PR fixes several javadoc issues reported by IntelliJ IDEA. Two types of errors are not handled in this PR:  - References which gradle is unable to resolve - these references seem to be valid javadoc links  so there s either an issue with gradle itself of with the configuration this project is using  and needs a deeper look - Javadoc tags missing descriptions  which require a deeper understanding of the methods in question in order to resolve. Replace  List<? extends Object>  in the constructor s argument list with a simpler  List<?> . The  extends Object  adds nothing  and just serves to confuse the reader. This patch allows calling  getStubbingArgMismatches  with any  Iterable   not just an  Iterable<Object>  in order to make it more convenient to use.  As seen in  ArgMismatchFinderTest   this saves having to cast potential arguments to raw types. Use generic specification instead of casting to the raw List type in order to make it a bit stricter.  Note that when we move to Java 8 language level these workarounds could be completely removed as the built in type inference should handle it. Make the javadoc of  Mockito#verifyZeroInteractions  to make it more obvious that it does the same thing as  Mockito#verifyNoMoreInteractions .  Fixes #977 Fix the misuse of  @Deprecated  in  PluginLoader#withAlias  -  @Deprecated  is an annotation  while the correct javadoc tag is  @deprecated .

This has a knock on effect on the evaluation of InvocationImpl.equals() which at runtime may be using a DelegatingMethod in its .equals().  I have changed .equals() and .hashCode() in DelegatingMethod to a more appropriate implementation  which can handle both the case where the input object is a DelegatingMethod and where it is a java.lang.reflect.Method.  I ran up against this issue when creating a custom VerificationMode which used InvocationImpl.equals() to check that the appropriate invocation was made.  My comparison failed even though I was comparing two references to the same InvocationImpl instance.,
1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,Tim Perry, 14 15,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1, Deprecated timeout().never()  in line with timeout().atMost() Verification with timout measures time more more accurately, Timeout().atMost() is deprecated due to issue 235: https://code.google.com/p/mockito/issues/detail?id=235  These exact same arguments apply to never()  both verification modes are extremely likely to create assertions that immediately pass  and do not test what they re intended to test. This patch therefore deprecates never() similarly.  Fairly shortly I m also planning on implementing verify(mock  during(x).[...])  as a counterpart to timeout which always waits the full time  as discussed in issue 347: https://code.google.com/p/mockito/issues/detail?id=347. This should allow for the kind of assertion behaviour that timeout().never() implies.  (Also some minor whitespace tidy up and spelling corrections) The previous timeout implementation doesn t measure time correctly: it only counts time spent intentionally sleeping  thus losing time on anything that happens when not sleeping (both the actual verification time  and time spent in other threads during verification)  and gaining time if any InterruptedExceptions occur.  Typically this means that timeout()s actually run for a longer than they re intended to. The fixed test demonstrates this well  previous the timeout was set to exactly the minimum possible time the sleeps in the code alone could ve taken  ignoring all processing time  and this test consistently passed. After the changes it now fails (as it probably should).  This patch fixes that by just measuring the time directly. I ve also fixed some variables names that were slightly annoying  and that now-failing test has a 500ms buffer before it times out.,

If using  One-liner stubs  (https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/2.23.4/org/mockito/Mockito.html#one_liner_stub) the mock object may be premature cleaned up and returning the mock fails with an exception. This occurs because there is no strong reference to the mock itself.  Therefore we need to maintain a strong reference to the mock until we ve returned it  while making sure that the GC can still cleanup the mock correctly when needed.  Cause implementations of  BaseStubbing  are intended to be cleaned up after usage  we can store a strong ref to the mock there.  getMock  then uses the strong ref (instead of the weak ref provided by the invocation). After cleaning up the implementations of   BaseStubbing  there is no strong ref to the mock itself anymore (except the one in the test class).

For example  with fields of type  [Iterable  Integer  Number]   it gives  Iterable == Integer  and  Iterable == Number   but also an inconsistent  Integer < Number .  I m not sure it s possible to sort consistently with a stateless  Comparator   so this change switches to a  sortSuperTypesLast  method that first sorts by name and then shuffles any subclasses to after their superclasses. It s slower  but should be deterministic. The existing tests are preserved by leaving behind a dummy  Comparator  that uses the new sort method. New tests make sure that the sorted ordering doesn t depend on the original order.  Fixes #155.,

Strict stubs don t work well with  common stubbing  pattern. They also don t like when we call stubbed methods with unexpected arguments - even though sometimes it is legit. For more  see #792   ### Solution     java @Test public void demo() {   //1.  lenient()  method on MockSettings interface:   Foo mock = Mockito.mock(Foo.class  withSettings().lenient())     //2.  lenient()  method on Mockito class:   Mockito.lenient().when(mock.foo(1)).thenReturn(1)    Mockito.lenient().doReturn(1).when(mock).foo(1)  }      For more  see #792  ### Public API changes  - New methods:    - Mockito#lenient()    - MockSettings#lenient()    - MockCreationSettings#isLenient()    - Stubbing#getStrictness()   - New interfaces:    - BaseStubber - extracted out from existing  Stubber  interface  so that we can reuse API with  LenientStubber     - LenientStubber - instance returned by  Mockito.lenient()  - Other changes:    - Made @org.mockito.NotExtensible annotation public so that we can use it in subpackages Let s keep adding test cases to ensure great coverage of the entire behavior.  Also updated documentation so that we consistently use the  lenient  vocabulary.  Stumbled upon it when working on #1272 ### Bugfix compatibility  For certain corner cases  this bugfix may be incompatible. We believe that the exposure is minimal (corner cases only  possibly incorrect tests)  and the bugfix important. If your test fails after upgrading to Mockito version that contains this fix  please scrutinize the test - it is very likely that the test is incorrect. We apologize for any compatibility problems arising from this change. It is a hard decision to make when a bugfix changes the behavior in a way it may not be compatible with every Mockito test in the world.  ### Problem  When stubbing with answers that call different mocked methods:    java when(mock.foo()).thenAnswer(() -> { otherMock.bar() }     we need to ensure that    mock.foo()    and    otherMock.bar()    don t interfere. Prior to this bugfix  this scenario resulted in various problems like: stack overflow error  unexpected stubbings declared on different mock  unexpected invalid return type errors.  For more details  see #1279  ### Solution  The solution is based on great PR #1296 by @r-smirnov. **Huge thanks** to @r-smirnov for reporting the problem diligently  then digging into the bowels of Mockito to find a clean solution  providing excellent test cases that demonstrate the problem. When I initially saw the issue report  I thought that it s not fixable and we would close it as  documented Mockito syntax caveat . Thank you @r-smirnov for persistence and getting this fixed! While working on @ChristianSchwarz s PR  I found the current documentation confusing.  - made the documentation clear  especially about the differences between timeout() and after() - removed mentions of internal API (new Timeout() constructor)  Fixes #91 Updated tests with after() verification mode - Some existing tests for the feature did not work due to flaws in ReplyRule. Those tests (now ignored) consistently failed but succeeded only when used with reply rule. - Some existing tests had weak assertions that did not fully cover the feature. - Suggested simpler and cleaner way of implementing delayed execution via new  AsyncTesting  class  instead of  DelayedExecution . Dropping the reply rule may introduce instabilities to the CI builds  let s observe and measure before making an action.  Although we are considering deprecating  after()   we need good coverage for an existing feature even if it will be removed in the long run. We don t need private constructor on an  internal  class. Internal classes can be changed at any time based on our compatibility policy. New coverage enables us to test @ChristianSchwarz s  within . I want to see all those tests working when we replace the internal implementation with  within . Preparing for merging major overhaul in the implementation of  timeout  and  after  APIs (#936).  We need coverage before we completely replace the existing implementation. When initMocks() fails we did not clean up the session listener. This led to a confusing error message on the next attempt to create a session (next test method run). I stumbled upon this problem when attempting to configure TestNG to use strict stubbing (https://github.com/mockito/mockito-testng/issues/1).  In order to fix this cleanly I need to keep the existing functionality that protects the user from forgetting to use  finishMocking() . Hence  I still need to throw an exception if the user adds the same listener multiple times. However  in the event that the listener is dirty  I clean it up automatically instead of failing. This way we can conveniently configure an existing  lenient  setting via an annotation. See the unit test that describes the feature.     Java @Mock(lenient = true) SomeClass mock Exposed new public API based on an internal API - StubbingLookupListener - #793.  As a rule of a thumb we try to expose the internal APIs that the top level features are built upon. Since StubbingLookupListener is useful for us to implement strictness  let s get the former exposed as public API. This way we build stronger framework with the concept of  onion skin API .  This PR replaces #1466 - very nice PR from @marchpig. Due to number of changes I needed to do  I decided to reimplement the feature  rather than use the original PR. @marchpig  thank you for understanding! Fixed issue with leftover state when stubbing with bad throwables. Fixes #1514 Created a minimal test that reproduces bug with smart nulls and generics  see issue #1551 Fixes #1655 We need higher version of JUnit Jupiter to reproduce and fix #1630  Added a test to enhance coverage Fixes #1630  This fix improves Mockito JUnit Jupiter extension. However  it does not completely resolve all kinds of parallel issues when nested test classes are used. I ll open a separate ticket for it. Fixed JUnit Jupiter MockitoExtension so that it behaves correctly in a parallel execution with nested tests. I found this issue recently when working on the extension. ThreadLocal here is OK but I m happy to use a different solution if someone has a better idea.  Added a new test that was failing prior to this change. Fixes #401  This is a breaking change because JUnit runner will now fail the test class if there is an unused stubbing.  Feedback is welcome. Sorry for working on it for a long time and big number of commits. Fixes #506 - Makes JUnit rules detect unused stubs - Introduces MockitoListener API - See the use case in issue #384  - Recreated PR #527 with squashed commits This PR concludes #401 Yay!!!!  Highlights: - fixed the thread safety problem by leveraging the same API that JUnit rules used for hinting at unused stubs - removed StubbingListener API (it could not work to the thread safety levels we support in Mockito  see also #545)  Closes #332 Fixes #401 Fixes #541  highlights: - started exposing full mock creation information instead of just type to mock and extra interfaces - changed public API but only for methods that were introduced in 2.x. So it is _not_ backwards incompatible change as far as 1.10 is concerned. Polishing the javadocs  starting with this small PR:  Issue #596 - updated @since to 2.1.0 (instead 2.0.0) - added more docs around the verification collector Based on feedback from Brice. Checks out line item in #596 When merged  this will produce new version 2.2.0 and set release/2.x to continuously publish 2.2.1  2.2.2  ... as new high quality features and enhancements are merged. Hurray!  Highlights: - set next version to 2.2.0 (arbitrary number) - reworked the conditional complexity to avoid accidental releases - removed custom release version logic because it does not work (not opposed to this feature  just cleaned up the code. This feature should be implemented in version.gradle file)   - for the time being  custom version can be achieved by using Gradle env variable: ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_version=2.3.0 (it looks like magic but it is a real feature from the Gradle book  ) - added basic docs around testing the release process (it s way too hard now) For motivation  see issue #543 The purpose of this RB is to give you heads-up about the improvements to the release automation that I work on. The algorithm is implemented and will not change much. Documentation  edge case unit tests and fixing runnability from Gradle are pending (Travis CI will fail on this PR).  The goal of the new  release-workflow  plugin is to able to express the release automation in the build.gradle file like that:      groovy releaseWorkflow {     step releaseNeeded     onlyIf { releaseNeeded.needed }     step bintrayUpload     step pullCommits     step configureGenericGitUser  cleanup: restoreGitUser     step commitReleaseNotes  rollback: resetReleaseNotes     step tagNewVersion  rollback: removeNewTag     step bumpVersion  rollback: unbumpVersion     step pushChanges }      More over  it will be very easy to test out the release locally or even individual release steps:      ./gradlew release -PdryRun ./gradlew pullCommits -PsingleStep See motivation and plan in #730 Improved documentation regarding unused stubbing detection  fixes #609 Fixes #756 New API (for rationale  see #769  for code review history see #770):     java //Existing API: @Rule public MockitoRule mockito = MockitoJUnit.rule()  //Proposed improvements: rule().strictness(Strictness.LENIENT) rule().strictness(Strictness.WARN)       // <-- is the default rule().strictness(Strictness.STRICT_STUBS)  // <-- Mockito 3.0 default      What  strict stubbing  means? - Improved debuggability: the test fails early when code under test invokes stubbed method with different arguments. - Cleaner tests without unnecessary stubbings: the test fails when there are any unused stubs declared. - Cleaner  more DRY tests ( Don t Repeat Yourself ): If you use Mockito.verifyNoMoreInteractions() you no longer need to explicitly verify stubbed invocations. They are automatically verified.  For background and motivation  check out [Szczepan s article on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/curious-how-get-even-cleaner-tests-new-mockito-features-faber). 1. No API / no behavior changes. 2. Publicly visible changes:   - Added missing Javadoc and updated an existing one for MockitoException and MockitoAssertionError classes 3. Remaining changes  refactoring:  - Rename job for consistency  - Removed some unnecessary code  - Made the tests more stable See the design and rationale at #840  Please review! Background:  - Mockito  strictness  is explained in #769  - Since 2.3.x Mockito JUnit Rules already provide opt-in  strict stubbing  capability  [see the javadoc](https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/2.4.5/org/mockito/junit/MockitoRule.html#strictness(org.mockito.quality.Strictness)).  This change adds new opt-in  strict stubbing  support for Mockito JUnit Runner. This behavior is tentatively planned to be the default in Mockito v3. Example usage:     java //Note  StrictStubs  inner class: @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.StrictStubs.class) public class ExampleTest {     // ... }            The behavior added by the StrictStubs runner is documented in the [javadoc](https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/2.4.5/org/mockito/junit/MockitoRule.html#strictness(org.mockito.quality.Strictness)). See also Javadoc improvements in code changes for this PR. The general direction of Mockito  strictness  is documented in #769. Reminds user if he forgets about  removeListener()  when working with [MockitoListener API](https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/2.5.0/org/mockito/MockitoFramework.html#addListener(org.mockito.listeners.MockitoListener)).  - Added a safeguard that reminds users to clean up MockitoListeners via removeListener() method. The implementation is very simple  checking if the type of the listener is already added. I found out about this problem when working on strict stubbing support without JUnit runner. - This change makes MockitoListener API safer. It s easy to leak state which we have encountered in our own test suite. - If we encounter legit use cases for adding the same listener type  we can remove the safeguard or updated it  The PR also contains a couple of refactorings and tidy-ups. I hope it s ok. See proposed design at #857  The code is reviewable  especially new public API. Please give feedback! More work is pending.  Current status:  - [x]  address @bric3 feedback   - [x] getter   - [x] javadoc - [x] review documentation for consistency   - [x] Mockito.session()   - [x] MockitoSessionBuilder   - [x] Strictness   - [x] MockitoHint   - [x] PotentialStubbingProblem   - [x] UnnecessaryStubbingException   - [x] MockitoJUnitRunner and subclasses   - [x] MockitoSession   - [x] MockitoRule - [x] Add / update mentions in the main Mockito class - [x] add validate mockito usage (should be very easy) - [x] Try making rules/runner use the session. They already reuse the code  they just don t use the API directly. Created #898 to track this work. - [x] Address @TimvdLippe feedback - [x] Create concurrent test (multiple sessions active in different threads) - [x] (non-code change  not blocking merge) GitHub tickets linked from source code should be better documented #769  #384. Alternatively  create ticket for tracking. - Continuous Delivery Pipeline 2.0 (#911) almost implemented! - Removed tons of release logic complexity  now all that is a part of general purpose  mockito release tools  project. - The new release automation should be much easier to test. ### Problem  Mockito does not do static mocking at the moment  Powermockito does. Powermockito uses a lot of internal Mockito APIs exposing the community to issues and wasted productivity on version upgrades. We want Mockito APIs to be easily extensible by framework integrators such us Powermockito without compromising API simplicity and consistency.  All proposed changes are backwards compatible in accordance to Mockito s compatibility contract (in short: limited changes to org.mockito.* types  freedom to change org.mockito.internal.*).  ### Public API changes  The full discussion on the use cases  implementation options and decisions is in #1110 ticket.  1. New public method for creating mock creation settings object:     java Mockito.withSettings().name(“my mock”).build(Foo.class)       2. Framework integrators can now provide custom MockHandler via    MockMaker#getMockHandler()   . Previously  it we didn’t offer this capability because we didn’t have convincing use cases that it was needed.  ### Public API considerations  1. Framework integrators may **not** provide custom implementation of    InvocationContainer    at this stage. This part of API is accessible via public    MockMaker#getMockHandler().getInvocationContainer()    method. There are no convincing use cases that exposing this new public API is needed. Not intended for merging yet  submitted for visibility.  - for design and rationale  see #1191 - for usage  see  VerificationStartedListenerTest  class  This is still experimental so refactorings  error handling  javadoc is missing. - While working on new verification started listeners (#1191) I found an instance of incorrect documentation. I added unit tests and simplified the documentation. - Currently  contrary to what the Javadoc said  we do guarantee the order in which invocation listeners get notified. Some of our users might have started to depend on this behavior. I added unit tests and fixed the Javadoc. In general  it is seems useful to guarantee the order. This way  the API is more predictable  easier to use.,

However I am hoping I can get this fix incorporated into an official version without implementing temporary workarounds.  The PR should clearly show the issue I am trying to fix  but I had to introduce a testCompile snapshot dependency.  The dependent project has a fix required to demonstrate the issue within Mockito but it unfortunately has not been incorporated into an official release  and I can t think of another way to reproduce the issue.  I have contacted the owner of the dependent project but I haven t received a response from them either.  I am looking for guidance on next steps for what I believe to be regression (reported to be working in #353).  The only other solution I can think of is to merge this without a unit test but I highly doubt that is desirable.  _Git Commit Message_ - problem - JUnitRule detects an unfinished mocking session when an inner class is detected - fix - if a MockitoSession has been established for JUnitRule  then use that and init mocks of the inner class. - tests - within an inner class ... ensure mocks are accessible  override outer class values when desired  retain original values if not overwritten - demonstrated with de.bechte.junit:junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner:4.12.2-SNAPSHOT,

There is no clean way to mitigate this problem completely. Hence  we introduced a new API to explicitly clear mock state (only make sense in inline mocking!):     java public class ExampleTest {       @After      public void clearMocks() {          Mockito.framework().clearInlineMocks()       }       @Test      public void someTest() {          //...      }  }      Due to the introduction of map from weak reference from mock instance to its invocation handler  Mockito became vulnerable to memory leaks as there are multiple situations where Mockito could unintentionally hold strong references to mock instances in the map record. The strong references could be through spiedInstance for spies  and arguments used to facilitate method stubbing.  Mockito could never know if the arguments passed in for method stubbing are also strongly referenced somewhere else or not  so Mockito needs to save a strong reference to these arguments to avoid premature GC. Therefore to solve cyclic strong references through arguments Mockito needs to explicitly know when mocks are out of their life  and clean up all internal strong references associated with them.    Fixes #1532 and #1533.,

Fixes #1254  Fixes #1256 Allow singleton locking in context with class loading races.  Fixes #1067 Use java.lang.MethodHandles.Lookup::defineClass if this mechanism is available on the current JVM. This might not work when interoperating with foreign modules  if those modules do not open and export their types  most prominently  the Java core modules where there are introduced issues with serialization.  This introduces a change in behavior for Mockito when using Java 9+. Unfortunately  I think that this is necessary for Mockito to continue to function after introduction of the JPMS. For now  it seems like this limitation only affects working with serializability in combination with platform types what is not too bad but there is a chance that we will discover issues once this new mechanism is picked up by the community. Fixes #1367. Use less expensive method graph compiler for inline mock maker. Update Byte Buddy for general performance improvements and bug fixes. Fixes #1364. Also fixes javadoc warning. This avoids the reallocation of certain objects that are expensive to compute. Also  Byte Buddy is updated. If certain types a type for the first time during instrumentation while our mocking engine relies on the same types  this can cause a circularity as checking if an instance is a mock requires instances of the latter types what again returns to the latter mock checking routine what causes an endless loop. (Described in comment.) Fixes #1240.  It is a bit difficult to reproduce this issue in our tests. It mainly happens with classes generated by Kotlin or Scala and requires the inline mock maker and a JDK 9 or older. If we want to add such a test  we can copy the test from https://github.com/guenhter/mockito-final-class-kotlin-problem The Java module system consideres packages of all named modules to be sealed. This results in the naming strategy to rename classes such that they cannot subclass package-private types. Solves https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/268 by explicitly checking for return types that represent a generic array and by resolving for the array s component type. Fixes #1013 - allows for static method mocking in Mockito. Due to the limited lifetime of static mocks  they cannot be validated within a Mockito session since they might have expired when the validation is applied. This patch excludes static mocks from all validation. To support static mocks in the regular session validation  we would rather need to trigger the validation upon release of any static mock. This PR adds code to constructors to allow short-wiring a constructor without avoiding to call it  thus making the use of Objenesis obsolete. This is desired since Objenesis relies on Unsafe API which is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  The idea is as follows: Any constructor for a class:     java class Foo extends Bar {   Foo() {     super(somethingWithSideeffect())    } }      is rewritten as follows:     java class Foo {   Foo() {     if (MockDispatcher.isMockedConstruction()) {       super(null)        return      }     super(somethingWithSideeffect())    } }      The mock dispatcher then applies a thead-local check to see if the current construction is supposed to be short-wired and suppresses the original construction in such a case. The check is repeated along the super class hierarchy until reaching the  Object  constructor which is by definition side-effect free. As a result  a mock was created without triggering any user code and without relying on Unsafe API. Improves the error message and does not create a hard dependency on the compiler module. It also points out that Byte Buddy can now emulate the attachment API using JNA if it s added to the class path. Does not include static mocks in regular listener logic as it might distort existing mock collectors that do not expect scoped mocks. Fixes #1988.  We have passed  Class  objects to the listener to indicate a static mock. The class object is of course itself not a regular mock and it s cleaner to create a callback method of it s own. This way  existing listeners remain logically backwards compatible  including our own listener that is used within the JUnit runner (we have only tested the rule  I added a test for the runner  too). Adds a  MemberAccessor  abstraction for accessing fields  methods and constructors where the default implementation  ReflectionMemberAccessor  implements the current behavior of using reflection and  setAccessible .   Also  this PR adds a new implementation  ModuleMemberAccessor  where the instrumentation API is leveraged to open modules to Mockito before using method handles to access any such member. This way  module boundaries are no longer stopping Mockito from functioning on Java 9 and onwards. Since the instrumentation API is already used by the inline-mock-maker  it is enabled for this mock maker by default. The previous cache used a lock to unify concurrency and weak references. Instead  keys are now explicitly wrapped using weak references and similarly to the functioning of a weak hash map  the entries are polled upon accessing the cache. This avoids blocking. Merged several pull requests into a branch prior to release. Merged several pull requests into a branch prior to release. Introduces animal sniffer with exclusion of inline-mock-maker classes which would never be present on Android. Avoids calling invoke/invokeExact methods of handles directly but rather puts the invocations into generated code to avoid breaking Android builds. Use constructor instantiation if explicitly specified. Fixes #2015. Fixes #2015. Adds error message to class loader setups that do not work with the inline mock maker. Fixes recursive constructor invocation. Avoids reflective access warning when using instrumentation-based member accessor. Fixes #2011 - triggeres initializers explicitly. Under heavy optimization mocks might get garbage collected during the dispatching of a mocked method if the mock instance is not used after this method dispatch. To avoid this  we escape the mock instance during the dispatch to make sure that the GC cannot collect the object.  Fixes #1802. Adds a plugin to allow for adding one or multiple mock resolvers. This way  instances that are provided to Mockito s DSL do no longer require to be the actual mocks but can also be proxies of mocks what is something already being applied by frameworks such as Spring.  This works today with the subclass mock maker by accident as we read the mock state from the mock instance via a method which gets proxied. If we ever find a more private appraoch this would however break Spring s Mockito use and it is already broken with the inline mock maker.  By this SPI  Spring could add an unproxy resolver to its Mockito build-up and make it s proxied mocks compatible with Mockito. Other frameworks could use the same approach if desired as this SPI is generic.  Closes #1980 Byte Buddy does exclude synthetic members by default as they normally provide necessary infrastructure outside of business logic (e.g. bridge methods). For constructor instrumentation  it is however crucial that no code is called during mock creation and that fields are copied during spy creation. Use Java 15 in builds for most recent Java version. Non-initializable classes can never be mocked  an error message should help guide on these issues. By clearing mocks  caches are emptied and instrumentations are reversed. Inline mocks allow for creating mocks of final types and final methods within any type. The inline mock engine also makes the mocking type invisible such that  mock(Foo.class).getClass() == Foo.class . Exceptions need to be made for abstract types and for types with serialization requirements where final methods are still instrumented but where a subclass needs to be created nevertheless. There are however few limitations of the inline mock engine that do not apply for the subclass mock engine: 1. It is no longer possible to mock  native  methods which do not provide any byte code that can be manipulated. 2. Synchronized methods remain synchronized as the instrumentation API does not allow the changing of modifiers.  The final mock engine is activated just like any other custom mock engine by placing an indicator file into the root folder. To make this more convenient  an alias mechanism was added where the mock type name can be referenced by _inline_. This improves error messages in case the dependency is not set up correctly. This should rarely happen but especially with the module system gaining traction  this might trigger a few bugs that we can better explain this way. Throwing a  MockitoException  from a mock maker constructor will cause the stack trace cleaning to be applied which itself relies on the plugin registry which is not yet initialized during the mock maker plugin s creation. This is both a performance improvement and a way of ensuring that no stack overflow error occurs upon looking up a  Method  instance which requires using a  HashMap  which causes an infitite loop upon mocking the hash map type. Fixes #818. Updated Byte Buddy  several performance and API improvements. Also with much better Android support. This enables Byte Buddy s new injection strategy for Android which loads types within a target class loader instead of creating a new one. Also  this updates Byte Buddy with a few bug fixes. Fixes #874. The documentation gave an incorrect configuration example. Also  warnings were added for using Android on a non-Android environment. I could trace the problem to more eager resolution of types in Java u31 upon loading where concurrent mock creation with locking on the class level causes a dead lock. This can happen in other VM implementations but can be solved with a more granular lock on our type cache.  This fixes https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/892. Added a preconfiguration for using the inline mock maker as a convenience artifact that can be included instead of creating the plugin file. This is very helpful when creating multi-module projects where the mock maker file has to repeated many times.  Once we choose to change the mock maker to be default or enable programmatic access  we can decide to drop this artifact similar to  mockito-all  from version one. Rather propagate them to mock maker that attempts instrumentation. Addresses #1005. …herefore override it explicitly from the inline mock maker. Stronger assertions on class loader origin when choosing what methods are mockable. Resolve the method hierarchy by Byte Buddy s method graph compiler to properly handle bridge methods which require a full method hierarchy analysis to detect. In order to properly discover visibility bridges  we have to run a full analysis of the method graph. The compilation of this method graph is rather expensive and we require to cache a computed graph. The caching is however non-trivial as it references classes which might be unloaded. In order to avoid a leak  we cache classes using non-strong references.  This requires some real-world experience to discover if this caching mechanism suffices. Fixes #1180: Compare against non-generic method when deciding if a method should be stubbed. The  MockSettings  now include an option to disable copying of annotations to mock classes. The override check implies Java compile patterns such that Kotlin method resolutions could fail for void return types which do not fit into Java s reference-type only generic hierarchies. This PR eases this restriction to fix this resolution for Kotlin.  I added the test case of the reported issue as a reference.,

One can of course claim that such methods _ought not to exist_  but sadly  this is not always the reality and I think that some pragmatism is useful in tools like Mockito  so here is my attempt at adding support for it.  Of course  it s possible to use the plain  Answer  interface in this case  but adding a dedicated  Answer6  interface makes it more convenient on the user   Answer  is a quite raw interface.  (I m not sure if this should target the 2.x release or  master  also  but feel free to cherry-pick as needed after review/merge.) I noted this while reading the Javadocs in my IDE  they were referring to a  get(0)  reference which isn t quite easy to grasp in this context. :see_no_evil: After looking at this class a bit more  I think it s just a copy-paste mistake from this line in the class-level Javadocs: https://github.com/mockito/mockito/blob/release/3.x/src/main/java/org/mockito/Mockito.java#L212 I started out with noticing the  safer that it was  part which felt like a typo. Then I realized there were perhaps more errors in this sentence (which was duplicated in multiple places in this file). Please verify that I understood the intent of this comment correctly  but my hope is that this is now the more correct way to express this.  Again  thanks for a great framework! :bow:,
