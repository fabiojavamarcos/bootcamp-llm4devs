To resolve the latter  I think the best approach is to check the custom CSS file exists.  This is already done for the Theme as used for most of the application  however the Preview Viewer has it s own CSS URL logic.  Rather than add file checking logic to the Preview Viewer  I have refactored and moved the theme logic of Preview Viewer into Theme  so that all CSS URL logic is encapsulated in that class. I have also put the logic that checks that the URL is valid and filters it to an Optional.empty() into one new method  additionalCssToLoad()  in place of the field of the same name. This ensure that the file existence check is performed in all cases  rather than just at construction of the Theme object.  I have kept the Optional<URL> field so there should be no overhead to this approach for the built in themes  and only the minor and necessary overhead of file existence checking for the custom theme.  For manual testing I checked:  - previews and overall appearance for default theme are correct  after restart - previews and overall appearance for dark theme are correct  after restart - previews and overall appearance with a custom theme with a valid name are correct  after restart - live changes to the custom theme still work  in general and for preview - rename custom theme so that the configured theme is no longer correct  **before application start**. The preview is no longer themed but there is no error. - the preview theme is restored when the filename is restored to the configured value  without restarting the application - Restart. Rename custom theme so that the configured theme is no longer correct  **while application is running**. The preview remains themed (typically sized CSS themes are data URL embedded and so survive file removal).  These tests were run both with the Gradle run task  and on the built binary (rationale: gradle presents the dark theme as a file  while the binary has it built in on a jrt: URL  so the results could be different).

This was done by adding a DialogWindowState class to the gui utils. This class stores the size and position of the dialog window. The StateManager class was modified to store this object. It is retrieved whenever a new DuplicateResolverDialog object is created to get the previous size and position and is updated whenever the user proceeds through the dialog options. The DialogWindowState class can be re-used if this feature is needed for other dialog windows.  This is my first ever pull request so please let me know what you think or whether I need to re-tool my approach to be more in line with the structure of the rest of the code!

For example  if there were to the entry list then the table view asks all entries if their values changes. Usually only a couple of entries are changed  so that only these entries need to be redrawn. But since the binding was re-created  actually all entries were redrawn instead.  Moreover  since every call to cell value factory created a new binding  a new invalidation listener was added to fields every time  leading to really high numbers of a few thousand invalidation listeners. I really hate myself for this stupid implementation 🙈 .  This PR fixes this problem by simply creating the bindings for each entry once  and then reuse. This lead to a massive performance increase as well as a huge memory consumption improvement. For example  sorting and filtering using groups in @AEgit huge database is now almost instant. Moreover  the memory is down from 2gb to a bit more than 1gb (this tells you how many useless invalidation listeners were there before).  Should fix the renaming issues in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5071. Might fix https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5919 as well as https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/5735.  <!--  - Go through the list below.

I think that concludes my series of performance improvements for now.   <!--  Describe the changes you have made here: what  why  ...  Link issues that are fixed  e.g.  Fixes #333 .

The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. -->  Right now it is pretty difficult to create dialogs in JavaFX using FXML. For once  you have to create a bunch of files (fxml  view  controller  view model) and there are huge problems with passing data between the caller and the controller (e.g.  no complex objects  cumbersome injection setup ...).  So I took the opportunity to rewrite parts of the afterburner framework to make the workflow more fluid. With these changes  the view class is merged with the controller and it is very easy to pass data to and from the controller. In particular  the code in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3005 should become much simpler.  Moreover  I started to embed the content of a few Swing dialogs (cleanup and preferences) in a JavaFX window. This is kind of proof of concept  works pretty nicely in my opinion and is probably the only way to fix the z-hierarchy issues with the old swing dialogs.   Git is not able to properly sort-out some of the changes (the merge of the view and controller classes) and shows a pretty huge diff. If git gurus like @koppor know a way to fix this  feel free to hijack this PR.   ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) <!-- describe the changes you have made here: what  why  ...

I played around a bit with JabRef in VS Code  and encountered a problem with the annotation processing. It was quite easy to fix by putting the files generated by the annotation processor in the  src/gen  folder.   Since VS Code uses the same libraries as eclipse under the hood  this fix should also apply to eclipse directly. @Siedlerchr can you please confirm. Thanks!

Reason for the remaining issue is described in https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4877#issuecomment-573701393. This is fixed in this PR by: - Consistently remember in the metadata which encoding was used when saving - The library mode is already determined (if not set explicitly by the user - which should be the normal case) upon import/loading instead of at an arbitrary point when the mode is first used. - No longer format field values upon writing  instead the written field values coincide exactly with the field values contained in the entry. The little pre-save processing (newlines  trim values) is now implemented as a mandatory save action.  Along the way  I refactored a bit of code (biggest change: remove Defaults class) and fixed very small code issues.  <!--  - All items with  [ ]  are still a TODO. - All items checked with  [x]  are done. - Remove items not applicable -->  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described (if applicable) - [ ] Tests created for changes (if applicable) - [ ] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef (always required) - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] [Checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): Is the information available and up to date?

At the moment  I used a flat and bright scheme with the original JabRef blue as the theme color.  ![scrShot](http://i.imgur.com/kOSJWNW.png)  In addition to the changes in the FX CSS files  I provide an additional true type font for the application icons that are not available in the Material Design Icon set. It can be loaded and used in exactly the same way as the Material Design Icons and only small changes to the code where necessary. As soon as we agreed on using this  I can make further adjustments and additions (currently  WinEd is missing) to the icons so that they fit perfectly into our toolbar. The one-colored icons should represent the original icon as much as possible and should be recognizable. The will look like this  ![i1](https://files.gitter.im/JabRef/jabref/W5wc/Lyx.png) ![i2](https://files.gitter.im/JabRef/jabref/W5wc/Emacs.png) ![i3](https://files.gitter.im/JabRef/jabref/W5wc/arXiv.png) ![i4](https://files.gitter.im/JabRef/jabref/W5wc/OpenOffice.png)  For those who would like to help to work on this:  Our base style is  modena.css  and to make our restyling easy to use and to understand  we should try to redefine the color variables of  modena.css  as much as possible instead of explicitly introducing and using our own variables. This means  don t use explicit color settings in the definition of styles for a control. If it is a commonly used property e.g. the border color  try to find and overwrite the appropriate modena-variable. If you indeed need a specific color  then re-use the ones defined at the top of  Main.css .  Remember that this is unfinished at the moment and I have rather commented out lines than simply deleting it.  ----  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [x] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [x] Ensured that [the git commit message is a good one](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git_commit_message) - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?)," || how is font-loading handled in the `jensdfxglyphs` library?

|| in your screenshot the arrow is never visible accept on hover because it is also white || use fx-mid-text instead? || please reactivate this because otherwise the rows are styled in a (ugly) strip-pattern || i disagree this is a usabiltily enhancement to difference between odd and even rows makes it much easier to see which entry is in which row  so called ""zebra striping"" || see also here for some general ideas about desinging data tables: || refactored this out i initially left it because maybe someone still needs a pixel icon in future but since it is really easy now to add svg icons if we indeed dont find anything appropriate in the existing ones this can be removed || i refactored this and used the same approach we (and material design icons as well) use its now loaded the static initializer of the `icontheme` class itself || thats what happens if you still need a lighter gray than `-jr-gray-0` :) i fixed it || it doesnt look good even the default padding is larger than it is in other applications but it looks ok compare these two images that show additionally the header of the mail program first as i have it now![current]( here with the additional padding![old]( menu items look lost in the menu bar the spacing is far too large i really would like to keep the default settingbtw in the colorful version we have now on `maintable-beta` this kind of made sense because it tried to mimic the look of todays web-pages with their very large top menus if you decide to work on a different scheme the large padding might be an option again but in this scheme it doesnt work and id like to keep it simple and unsurprising for the user || im against this although the font is only one pixel larger on my system and the anti-aliasing is also ok it introduces a very notable font-difference to the main-table where there should be consistency  i would accept if this is wanted by most devs but from my point of view it is not ok || ok for a scheme that wants to set a different bg for the sidepane than in other controls this makes sense || i would leave it like that the current separator is derived from the main colors and looks good `-jr-separator` is not used (or even defined) anymore it was from my first tests where i tried to define these myself when cleaning up im going to remove it || i still like the second screenshot more and find it more touch-friendly but well we just have different tastes and i definitely understand your viewpointprobably every dev should create an own theme and we then vote which should be the default   || good catch i introduced a color for it in `maincss` and set it to our orange this looks decent and the indicator is visible when you drag it over a marked entry || ok convinced the base font size should be the same but i still think the hit-number can be smaller because this is kind of unimportant infoby the way did you change the padding of the tree node items? they have a bit tighter feeling than on the current master/maintable-beta which probably results not from the difference of font-sizes || in my tests the commented section is the color of the small arrow when the group is selected this setting is not required anymore as far as i understand it because the arrow has not the same color as the icons and our markup color is bright it looks currently like this![indicator]( for me the arrow is always visible and looks ok even when the entry is selected"

I am not a GUI expert and am wondering whether my fix is appropriate and is considered clean in the MVC-concept. Since the functionality was already implemented in the LinkedFileViewModel  I just created an instance and let it handle the download. Is that ok? If not  copying the code over (and resolving some dependencies) would be the easiest  but also the dirtiest solution to this problem. Is there an appropriate place the code in LinkedFileViewModel could be moved  so it is callable in ImportEntriesViewModel?

Clicking it opens a pop-over that lists the background tasks with an icon  title  message and progress.  In order not to overwhelm the user with background tasks  only interesting ones are shown. To make a background task show  it needs to have the showToUser property set. For it to have a meaningful entry  one should set the title and message to appropriate values. If progress can be tracked  that should be done as well. If not  an indeterminate indicator / progress bar is shown. To set the icon of the task  add a mapping from the task-title to an icon to the iconMap in BackgroundTask.java  <!--  - Go through the list below.

Looks like it uploads full database from disk every time you need to calculate No of items in group. Therefore  if you have 1 thousand groups  it will read the entire database 1 thousand times.   UI changes: - added new checkbox in Preferences/Groups -  Display quantity of items in group   - added new property DISPLAY_GROUP_QUANTITY to JabRefPreferences.java file  - connected new checkbox with JabRefPreferences.java. I used another preferences as a sample   Logic changes: - I added link to JabRefPreferences in GroupTreeView class.  If user wants to display groups quantity  a panel with quantity will be shown. Quantity is calculated when GroupNodeViewModel class is initialized  so I decided to wrap a panel into an  if  statement.  Tests passed. Fixes #6065   1. Fixed an issue with  duplicate values in  Abstract field   2. Checked code and couldn t reproduce second error:  publication date is taken from the Y2 field  not from the correct Y1  See lines 207-220 of  RisImporter.java .

This was a result of internal developer discussions  mostly in 2018 and before.  Thus  I thought  it is a good time to add an [ADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/).

This is a minor update on PdfContentImporter  which fixes minor issues and enables a broader test. Fixes https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/74.   pureauth  was not implemented correctly. This PR fixes it and does some refactoring  - Remove  Optional  as parameter in two cases - Split tests. The new database tests cannot be run locally as it requires postgres and MySQL to be installed. Therefore  I reused the idea of the integration tests to separate the tests as  databaseTest .  Alterantive solution: AssumeTrue (http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2009/10/07/using-junits-assume-for-faster-tests/) in  @BeforeClass  and check whether the database is there. I opted for the separate grdle task to make it obvious when the database test is done and when not.  <s>Minor thing: I added  AssertUtil.assertDoesNotThrow  (inspired by http://stackoverflow.com/a/37203455/873282) to improve the output of unexpected exceptions.</s> This is a follow-up to https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/6283.  I open this PR just for documentation. No need to review.  ---  While reviewing https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/6426  I found out  the contributors did not have setup the code style properly. Thus  I now put [LeftCurly](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/config_blocks.html#LeftCurly) in place  which enforces that there are no statements directly appended after an if.     diff -public DoubleProperty widthProperty() { return widthProperty  } +public DoubleProperty widthProperty() { +    return widthProperty  +}      I am aware that for simple values  this causes more lines without improving things. Nevertheless  I vote for consistent code.  The **future** should be to rewrite minor code style issues (unused imports  line breaks  ...) automatically. The current tool of choise is [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless). Also [Google s refaster](https://errorprone.info/docs/refaster) should be put in place. It has *very* advanced rewriting templates. For instance:     java assertEquals(true  ...)       can be automatically rewritten to     java assertTrue(...) We have Markdown files  where [linting issues](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/master/doc/Rules.md) and wrong links could be contained. This PR adds a check for it.

This applies the quick fix proposed at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7083. To implement the full functionality a longer thought on previews is requried.  I think  the first proposal is a good step towards a better preview: Show the full names of authors and editors  to list the editor only if no author is present  have the year ealier.   I disliked the default preview style  but could not make any (good) proposal.

Here  the Medline tests are fixed. Fixes #5602  refs #2768.  Wanted to know why our GUI tests are broken. The reason seems to be that we don t pass the preferences objects directly around  but use  Globals.prefs  at more places. Currently  the issue is in  MainTable.java :     java         importHandler = new ImportHandler(                 frame.getDialogService()  database  externalFileTypes                  Globals.prefs.getFilePreferences()                  Globals.prefs.getImportFormatPreferences()                  Globals.prefs.getUpdateFieldPreferences()                  Globals.getFileUpdateMonitor()                  undoManager                  Globals.stateManager)       I would propose to convert the constructor of  MainTable  (and  BasePanel ) to a builder pattern (because we have more than three arguments) and add passing of these preferences.  Alternatively  we can mock  Globals.prefs.GetFilePreferences()  etc. This is also OK for me as I accept global objects. However  we had a long discussion that we should get rid off  Globals .  Is https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1579 the right issue  where we discussed  Globals.prefs ? I think  the comment at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/1593#discussion_r71328057 summarizes the discussion.

TeX supports working with bibtex: http://www.tug.org/tetex/html/eplain/etex_7.html. However  it is very uncommon to use TeX together with JabRef ^^.

While working on https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/6109  we found  we need to refactor the  save  things to understand what s going on. ^^  - Get rid of  doSave()  - Add notification for non-successful save in case of  SaveAll  - Remove deprecated  setDatabaseFile  (as we are Java8 with Path) (and don t allow new tasks to be executed)  This fixes https://github.com/jabref/jabref/issues/6109.  We invesitgated the shutdown procedure. We think that a thread creating a  .sav  file is still hanging around AFTER the throttler was shut down. And the  .sav  file was deleted afterwards. The  .sav  file was recreated after the deletion... When JabRef is forced-closed and restarted  it should not nag about a  .sav  file.  The issue described at https://github.com/jabref/jabref/issues/6109 seems to be a larger one. We will that investigate later.

Run EprintCleanup on a copy of the entry the ArXiv fetcher is fetching before getting arXiv id from the eprint field  2. Add two test method. One finds full text with title containing colon and journal  while another finds full text with title containing colon and url.  ## Problem When finding full text  this BibTeX reference works:     @Article{booth_bayes-trex_2020    author        = {Serena Booth and Yilun Zhou and Ankit Shah and Julie Shah}    journal       = {arXiv:2002.10248v4 [cs]}    title         = {Bayes-TrEx: a Bayesian Sampling Approach to Model Transparency by Example}    year          = {2020}    month         = dec    archiveprefix = {arXiv}    eprint        = {2002.10248}    url           = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10248v4}  }     ![#7660-0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48386227/115873907-13c97c80-a476-11eb-821f-24598bd1a8a9.png)  But when  eprint  field is missing  no full text will be found:     @Article{booth_bayes-trex_2020    author        = {Serena Booth and Yilun Zhou and Ankit Shah and Julie Shah}    journal       = {arXiv:2002.10248v4 [cs]}    title         = {Bayes-TrEx: a Bayesian Sampling Approach to Model Transparency by Example}    year          = {2020}    month         = dec    archiveprefix = {arXiv}    url           = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10248v4}  }     ![#7660-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48386227/115873922-188e3080-a476-11eb-80e7-222c58ee4e09.png)  ## Solution Since the title contains colon and arXiv uses colon to represent key and value  the title may be recognized mistakenly. So use other fields to get the eprint field to avoid this problem. Thanks to the advice from @tobiasdiez .  ## Screenshots After fix: ![#7660-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48386227/115873880-0f04c880-a476-11eb-9291-82e011f87ab3.png)   - [x] Change in  CHANGELOG.md  described in a way that is understandable for the average user (if applicable) - [x] Tests created for changes (if applicable) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef (always required) - [x] Screenshots added in PR description (for UI changes) - [x] [Checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): Is the information available and up to date?

Why? - splash screen on modern systems is shown only for a very short period of time as JabRef starts fast - we should focus on making JabRef to start as fast as possible. A splash screen reduces the time to start the software as additional code needs to be executed.  - for each new version (even for beta and dev versions)  we have to check in a png with 200KB file size into the repository. This increases the amount of storage required for the git repository by 200KB for each version/dev-version. - The splash screen interferes with using JabRef via the CLI.  - It reduces code in JabRef. Hence  less code needs to be maintained.  This is a PR that is open for discussion. Please add any pros/cons as you see fit. Why? - because it is ugly :taxi:  - keep consistent icon width - removes 140 lines of code  five icons  one preference check box,

A first approach to convert the add/edit group dialog to the mvvm-pattern and a step forwards to implement the changes @MartinKarim supposed in #4684 . Still some problems and things to talk about.  The most obvious one is: GroupDescription. I really don t know what to do with this. Personally I think  this description stuff shuld go into the help page. It s a wild mesh-up of error messages  validation messages for the regex and some hints about the group...  The next thing are the different group types. @MartinKarim supposed to merge most of them  as they mostly intersect each other. But if we do this  we need to provide migrations for the old groups too. This would probably go far beyond this PR.  Screenshot below  The old labels of the checkboxes a displayed as a tooltip now. But they should be better placed in the help page.  I have some problems with the validators. Somehow if i bind the disableProperty of the ok button to validProperty of the validator  Java throws a NPE. If I don t get this working  I need to think about a workaround.

I made some controversial decisions here: Although AbbreviateAction (and UnabbreviateAction) as well as AppendLibraryAction are somewhat broken  I decided to port them to Actions even in the somewhat broken state  to move forward with this PR and not to make this PR more complicated than it is anyways. SaveAction is just a Wrapper for SaveDatabaseAction  which needs some love in refactoring (Exporters rely on accessing directly SaveDatabaseAction::save or saveAs).  BaseAction is now completly removed with this PR and the command pipeline relies now completly on SimpleCommand. Maybe this is an opportunity to think about reworking the UndoManager now as @tobiasdiez [proposed](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/5958#issuecomment-590077978)?  - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described (if applicable) - [ ] Tests created for changes (if applicable) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef (always required) - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] [Checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): Is the information available and up to date?

This PR fixes koppor#430  It took a little bit more refactoring than expected  for it does not only check  if StandardField.FILE has text inside  but if the file is also really present in the file system. There are some design decisions i m unsure of: There is no alert about that no file is really present. The menu entry is just disabled  although there is a file symbol in the main table (since StandardField.FILE is not empty). Feedback could be implemented in the files editor in the entry editor as validation. The other thing is that in theory at last  the table does not yet automatically update  if a file is added or removed (so no file is attached). This would require  probably an array of observables to be used as an invalidation alert. I m unsure where to start with that. However  only in theory. Pracitcally the entry is unselected automatically if I change something about the attached files in the entry editor. So nobody would notice  if this would not be implemented.   - [ ] Change in CHANGELOG.md described (if applicable) - [ ] Tests created for changes (if applicable) - [x] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef (always required) - [ ] Screenshots added in PR description (for bigger UI changes) - [ ] [Checked documentation](https://docs.jabref.org/): Is the information available and up to date?

This happens because  codeArea  can be disabled  but there is no code path that re-enables it.  This patch re-enables  codeArea  as editable if the BibTeX entry s source code is correct. Although the source tab cannot be used by the user to fix any syntax error in BibTeX fields (source tab will be disabled if there are syntactic errors introduced by editing the fields in the other tabs)  such error can be fixed by editing the field  which will trigger  SourceTab  s listener and call the  updateCodeArea()  method  which will enable codeArea if the source of the BibTeX entry is syntactically correct.   <!--  - Go through the list below.

Here  I am systematically evaluating the capabilities of fetchers. This is a) for documentation in code b) to check whether the fetchers change their capability over time. I accept that tests may fail due to changing external services.  Follow-up PRs will come making use of the new functionality in the UI. This is a rather small PR to easy review (@stefan-kolb ^^).

A null is prepended to an abbreviated BibTeX key. 2. Curly brackets are not respected (in the maintable s author column?).  **1. Fix to the prepended null** *What is going on?*  BracketedPattern.generateInstitutionKey  gets called for any author enclosed in curly brackets (e.g.    {The School of Life}  ). The method expects an institute of technology or university and appends its name to the key (e.g.  null if there is no name).  *Why is it going on?* Academic institutions can have long generated BibTeX keys unless abbreviated  e.g.    Royal Institute of Technology: The School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science    which  generateInstitutionKey  shortens to  RITEECS .  *Fix* Replace a null valued university with an empty string. The drawback is potentially very short BibTeX keys (e.g.   The School of Life  ->  L ).  *What are alternatives?* 1. Regex matching universities and technological institutions  which is hard to implement correctly. On the other hand  the drawback is an unexpected BibTeX key in a corner case. In the case of  The School of Life  would be abbreviated to  SL  instead of  L .  **2. Fix to the author column** When the list of authors gets converted to a latex-free version  all curly brackets are removed since the whole string is parsed as latex. When the latex-free string is used to create/fetch an  AuthorList  it will no longer contain any brackets  and the information needed to format the string is gone.  **3. What I think is left to do** - [x] Find out why  {The School of Life}   isn t respected in the author field of the GUI - [x] ~~Attempt to match universities etc. with regex~~ Assume that names that have comma separated parts are universities - [x] ~~Update  BibtexKeyGeneratorTest  as it makes heavy use of deprecated methods~~ the deprecated methods are essentially convenience methods so they have been moved inside the test file - [x] See if the readability of  generateInstitutionKey  can be improved - [x] ~~Change the key generator for institution/corporate names to a Formatter?~~  generateInstitutionKey  should not be a separate Formatter  it is only called by  normalize .  and  <!--  - Go through the list below.

Some unicode characters can be encoded in multiple ways  and the mapping that  StringUtil#replaceSpecialCharacters  relies on does not contain all cases. The proposed solution uses [NFC](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/text/Normalizer.Form.html#NFC) to re-encode the characters so that these characters can be found. There exists more information on [Unicode normalization in the Java API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/text/Normalizer.Form.html#NFC).  My subjective opinion is that most people expect Unicode to work similar to NFC  i.e.  if characters looks the same  it is likely that they are equivalent. Hence  if someone debugs issues in the  UNICODE_CHAR_MAP   they will expect NFC. A more holistic approach should likely start with the [compatibility equivalence](http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Compatibility_Equivalence_Figure)  which will require larger changes  and there does not seem to be any bugs/issues that requires these larger changes.  <!--  - Go through the list below.

Character classes (regex expressions in brackets  e.g.   [a-zA-Z] ) should be usable with the regex modifier  but it currently isn t for citation keys.  Bracketed patterns are parsed using several different methods in  CitationKeyGenerator.java    BracketedPattern.java  and  AbstractCitationKeyPattern .

The title of the PR must not reference an issue  because GitHub does not support autolinking there. --> Fixes #6942. Fixes #7199.  #### TL DR Authors only having a last name are abbreviated. #6942 is miss-abbreviated because name parts containing  uni  are assumed to be universities  e.g.   United Airlines . #7199 is triggers the abbreviation method because  from BibTeX´s point-of-view  the author only has a last name. The name is later removed because Java does not classify the first character as an uppercase letter  hence the heuristic assumes it is an insignificant word. E.g.   {eBay}  gets removed   {JabRef}  doesn t.  #### Background Authors that are institutions can have very lengthy citation keys unless they are abbreviated in some fashion. The abbreviations are generated in  https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/6718c08cf5ace13365da2ce4c1509e4817eb34bc/src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/citationkeypattern/BracketedPattern.java#L1243  which is based on a heuristic that tries to determine a suitable abbreviation based on the content of the specific author.  Issue #6942 is due to a regexp being overly broad when determining if an author is a university.  Issue #7199 was created from #6706 where I changed how a company/institute is identified. In previous versions of JabRef  an author is an institute if it is enclosed in curly brackets (e.g.   {JabRef} )  and I changed it to also include authors  who only have a last name (e.g.   JabRef )  which means that the author in issue #7199 is treated as an institution. This would not have been an issue if it wasn t because the heuristic for creating a citation key identifies words starting with a lowercase letter in the author s name as an invalid part of an institute abbreviation. Think of the  and  in  National Aeronautics and Space Administration ). Since the author s name only consist of one  word   it is removed. (this is why the workaround @tobiasdiez mentioned does not work  even if it should)  #### Changes for #6942 1. Identifying universities in the authors  names is arbitrary. The new regexp matches  ^uni(v|b|$).*  instead of  ^uni . There are other suggestions in #6706 that can be implemented instead. 2. The inline institute abbreviation should now work again (e.g.   {JabRef ({JB})}  should produce  JB ) 3. I am ignoring the  shortauthor  field  because I find it unclear how and when to use the field (e.g.  for multiple authors).  #7199  1. I ll change how institutes are identified  so that the  Author  must only have a last name and that last name must contain a space. This should only happen if the  Author  originally were enclosed in brackets. In all other cases I d argue it is acceptable to not abbreviate the author since the name is only one word.     1. Drawbacks to this approach is that I am using the LatexToUnicodeAdapter to remove braces  and it doesn t like unbalanced ones.  <!--  - Go through the list below.

The bracketed pattern  [title]  does not refer to the StandardField title  but a  special  pattern intended to give nicer output (this is why dashes don t work  see https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4342#issuecomment-742722875). It is intended and can be **avoided** by using  [TITLE] . 2. An expanded bracketed pattern is interpreted as a regexp (which it should not). This is why parenthesizes doesn t work. A pattern that expands into  (abc)  will match  abc   but not  (abc) .   If the expanded bracketed pattern contains characters that have a special meaning in regexp (such as a parenthesis and brackets)  it becomes a problem. An entry with the title  Regexp from [A-Z]  and the bracketed expression  [TITLE]  would match a file titled  Regexp from B   but not a file named  Regexp from [A-Z] .  #### The goal of this PR  Match files whose expanded bracketed pattern includes symbols that can be miss-interpreted.  1. **Regex**: All expanded brackets will match literally   using  Pattern.quote . I don t see a reasonable use-case for allowing a bracket to expand into an actual regex. 2. **Cleaned filenames** _In addition_ to matching the regularly expanded brackets  they will also match cleaned file names (it will find files containing both  ACM/IEEE-CS  and  ACM_IEEE-CS ).  **Note**: Regex can still be used outside of the bracketed patterns. (except for character classes  since they will be interpreted as a bracketed pattern)  #### Issues neither addressed in this PR nor the current master 1. Files that get truncated due to length 2. Character classes in the RegExpBasedFileFinder. In the following pattern   **/.*[title][a-z]+.*\\.[extension]    [a-z]  is treated as if it is a bracketed pattern 3. BracketedExpressions are only expanded in the file name  **not in the directory name**.  #### Checklist  - [x] ~Check if parts can be replaced by a glob (<a href= https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher(java.lang.String) >getPathMatcher</a>)~ - [x] Improve finding and parsing bracketed expressions? - [x] Fix this particular use case using regexp literals (\Q\E in the regexp)     - [x] ~Add type-safety to the expanded bracket (return a compiled Pattern when it is supposed to be a RegularExpression)~ - [x] Check that the expanded bracketed expression result in a correct filename  and/or convert it into one.

The main cause for this issue was in the Linux implementation of NativeDesktop(Linux.java#openFolderAndSelectFile)  that code looks for  an environment variable named  DESKTOP_SESSION  and if this variable is not set in any system then it will result in Null Pointer Exception.  The Fix was to check if  DESKTOP_SESSION  variable is present or not  if not present then run a default command which will try to open the folder.  Another issue was that if a system does not have a file browser installed then right-clicking on any entry and selecting  open folder  option will not do anything(if there is no file browser installed in the system).

For me this seems OK.).  I offer this PR since the fix was *very* simple (SEH == Sunday Evening Hack  ) )  and brings a lot of useful functionality IMHO. The alternative name suggestions are possible but will need considerably more effort...  <!--  - Go through the list below.

This PR removes this dependency. The biggest change is that two Look and Feels go and that particularily affects Linux users.  I have used the Nimbus Look and Feel as the new default for Linux  but we can change that or even search for better Java 9-compatible Look and Feels. I have also added a preferences migration in case a user has set one of the incompatible Look and Feels.  I would suggest that we wait with merging this after we have release 4.1. Java 9 does not yet matter for 4.1 and we should give the Linux users a stable JabRef that still has the old Look and Feels before moving on.   ----  - [X] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [ ] Tests created for changes - [ ] Screenshots added (for bigger UI changes) - [X] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef - [ ] Check documentation status (Issue created for outdated help page at [help.jabref.org](https://github.com/JabRef/help.jabref.org/issues)?) - [ ] If you changed the localization: Did you run  gradle localizationUpdate ? …are resolved  Attempts to fix #3498  It seems that the internal state of DatabaseChangeMonitor was not updated correctly when external changes were marked as resolved  causing the monitor to misbehave when you tried to save afterwards.

With this PR  this is no longer the case. The only problem is that the formatting of meta data items is not parsed (and this would be a bigger thing)  since so far we assumed full control over the meta data items. This version tries to keep formatting as far as possible  but does a few customizations (escaping     and adding newlines where appropriate). The result is that you can rename a  groupstree  meta data item and it will be kept and formatted in the very same way  also with a different name.  I would say this is good enough and we adapt it when someone has a use case or problem.  - [X] Change in CHANGELOG.md described - [X] Tests created for changes - [X] Manually tested changed features in running JabRef, || i would actually prefer to rename `updatetimestamp()` to `markassaved` that the `databasechangemonitor` uses the timestamp and file size to keep track of the last saved state should be an implementation detail that is hidden to the outside world || alright i changed the name back to what it was before

I noticed that @zongxian said that a path containing Chinese characters would cause the same error. So the problem is not just related to delimiter  probably about text encoding.  Therefore I encoded the arguments in  RemoteClient.sendCommandLineArguments  and decoded them in  Protocol.receiveMessage .  Then I created a binary and tested. Now it works well on my computer (Windows 10 1909).

If not created an issue at <https://github.com/JabRef/user-documentation/issues> or  even better  submitted a pull request to the documentation repository. Fixes #7127   In issue #6920 the detection of exact short dois was improved. This was relevant where short dois were misplaced under the wrong field of an entry. This did not affect the method  public static Optional<DOI> findInText(String text)   which looks for dois _within_ text (not exact matches).  With this commit  I have carried the improvements over to the _within-text_ detection. I had to make the detection more stringent  to avoid mis-detections for cases like _bla bla 10:30 bla bla_ or _bli blubb 10/12/2020 blibb blabb_ etc. Short dois within text will now only be detected if there is any _doi_ or _urn_ within the substring. E.g. any of the following will be detected:  - doi:10/12ab - /urn:doi:10/12ab - doi.org/10/1234 - doi.org/ab123 (shortcut doi) - etc..  I also introduced the concept of _shortcut dois_ to the in-text detection. (e.g. _doi.org/xyz123_)  <!--  - Go through the list below.

i seems like you dont need the additional features of the list property (ie complete replacement of the list) || the convention was to name these variables without the `property` suffix || please extract `globalsentrytypesmanager` as constructor paramater || why is this call needed in the first place? || `typesforfield` seems to be a misnomer as its the other way around variable can be inlined anyway in my opinion || this should be localized || `entry` is a bit confusing (usual reserved for bibentriesr || please use `statemanager` instead of `jabrefframe` moreover bind `executable` correctly as in eg  || localized?

|| for this you only need an observable list list properties allow you to change the list completely (which triggers a different kind of event) its essentially a `objectproperty<observablelist<t>>` || then i think the should go into the apply method otherwise other places in jabref are still working with the old version || yeah that works as well   || please use `easybindmap(type type::getdisplayname)` || i guess the whole process starting has to be done in a different thread || thats totally weird as to what i read about is that the process is executed and only if you call waitfor the app blocks  the stream gobbler is there to capture the output  || strange can you please try the processbuilder which anyway seems to be the preferred way to start subprocesses  || does this need to be closed?
